        "description": "Double murder and life goes on as if nothing happens. No remorse. So they're both psychopaths? Shades of \"Double Indemnity \" but a comedy? I would have given it an ambiguous ending like a French film. (See \"Anatomy of a Fall\" ). In the alternative, had we witnessed the husband battering the wife, we could have easily accepted a killing in in self-defense Yes, that would work. (See Grisham's \"The Rainmaker). Had they brought in The Coen Brothers or David O'Russell to rewrite the ending, they could have had a 10 -Star movie.Up to the point of learning that Madison was the killer of her husband, I thought the movie was very entertaining. Powell and Linklater created some very interesting characters. Glen Powell has distinguished himself as a comedic actor. I hope to see him in many more leading roles.",

Nothing less, nothing more. A lukewarm experience.It's even, consistent, but never warms up to 30 C degrees or over. I guess that was intentional given the real life implications of the story. It might have been more exciting at times, even frantic in certain scenes, but it wasn't. What a pity.From a movie making point of view, it is almost impeccable. Good direction, simple but effective camerawork, good score and editing, and most of all, superb acting makes it a good and quite joyful watch.If you look for a light entertainment, there you go. You can leave your brains at home. No worries.",

It should provide all sorts of setups for dark comedy and the means to upend both genres. Unfortunately this movie skews too far in the direction of romcom. There's a funny prelude in which Glen Powell showcases his comedic chops under the guise of various personas. After that the the movie becomes an extended one-note joke in which the gag is simply that it's a romcom with horrible people as the protagonists. The idea wears out its welcome long before the movie ends and otherwise not a whole lot happens.",

        "description": "This was billed as a quirky, clever Rom-Com by both its trailers and critics. The trailers looked fantastic, like a spirited passion project between Linklater and Powell that would parody the whole Rom-Com genre in witty fashion. The reality is this is just another Rom-Com film with critics falling head-over-heels with Linklater (as they always do). The most interesting part of the film is actually the first act, when Glen Powell gets to shine in a diverse portfolio of characters, including a long, gritty dialogue exchange. By the time the love interest appears in the second act, the film has already fallen into just another collage of good cop/good person/bad circumstance entanglement. Unfortunately the film never really redeems itself, nor its characters in unforgiveable acts. Its story feels mundane and outcome certain. While I had hoped for more, it was at least an easy viewing.",

His charisma always shines through and there's an instant connection to him and his character that never wanes. Matching him perfectly is Adria Arjona, the chemistry between them absolutely electric.My only real complaints with this film are that it took too long to get going and was over far too quickly. Aside from these pacing issues there really isn't much to complain about with this film.So if you are in the mood for a funny, sexy and dramatic film that will draw you in to it's weird and mysterious story then look no further than Hit Man.",

        "description": "If you enjoy quirky movies, director Richard Linklater is your guy. His latest is HIT MAN, which is a romantic comedy that's very loosely based on an article about a real guy, Gary Johnson. Gary (Glen Powell) is a college professor and part-time staffer at the New Orleans Police Department. He stumbles into a new role as an undercover hitman, arresting people who try hiring him to kill someone. It turns out he's very good at it. Powell really showcases his talents here, playing different characters for each arrest. When he meets Madison (Adria Arjona) though, he breaks protocol. I guess Powell has great chemistry with whoever he works with. He has an undeniable charm that seems like it spreads to the whole cast. I could tell they had fun filming this. It also has a very smart script, playing with ideas of identity and being your true self. The strong sense of humour actually changes as the movie progresses, which was fun for me, but might not work for some. I find it hilarious that they must've asked the real Gary Johnson for permission to go as far as they do here. The movie makes it clear what actually happened during the end credits. HIT MAN is quirky, unconventional, and very enjoyable. If you can't see it in theaters, don't worry! It'll be on Netflix June 7th. Make sure the algorithm doesn't bury it. Enjoy!",

        "date": "7 October 2023",
        "description": "Hitman is definitely a film-lover's paradise but even the casual film viewer will thoroughly enjoy this brilliant new movie. Linklater's latest lovingly pays homage to film noir, screwball comedy, Hitchcockian black comedy and even the good old psychosexual drama but it still somehow manages to conjure up a fresh, witty and often uproarious confection that frequently teases, delights and occasionally thrills the audience with frissons of excitement, keeping them enraptured all the way to its deliciously razor sharp ending.This is potentially a star-making turn for Glen Powell. Although he made a strong impression in Top Gun: Maverick as a cocky rival pilot, his role in Hit Man is easily more complex and, as the co-writer of the script, he has been able to add brilliant layers to his character, or should that be characters? In effect, Powell is playing more than one character - Gary Johnson, mild-mannered, cat-loving geeky Psychology professor and audio techie who moonlights as a surveillance expert for a Louisana-based police unit that targets and stings hapless ne'er-do-wells who are looking to hire a killer. Before the next sting operation, Gary's police colleague Jasper (Austin Amelio) who normally pretends to be the hired killer is suspended for brutally attacking two youths, which forces Gary's colleagues (brilliantly played by Retta and Sanjay Rao) into convincing Gary to take over from the universally loathed Jasper, much to Gary's dismay. Yet, within minutes of taking on the task, Gary suddenly morphs into \"Ron\" and during his first sting he is so convincing that his colleagues are shocked, even though they had believed he could do it having heard Jasper go through the rigamarole on previous occasions. It is a brilliant piece of acting.Having created the killer persona, Gary soon finds himself becoming more and more immersed in Ron, adding further, chameleon-like layers of disguise and character traits to mirror whoever is about to be stung. However, things become really complicated (in true film noir style) when \"Ron\" is approached by a femme fatale, Maddy (beautifully played by Adria Ajrona who also adds a delightfully a kooky sexy edge as well as a tender vulnerability). As the sparks between the two begin to fly during a hilarious but flirty exchange, Gary, who is clearly enjoying himself as Ron, finds himself conflicted. Dare he. As Ron, continue with the sting and have Maddy arrested for plotting to murder her husband? Has the flirtatious exchange caused Maddy to betray some regrets about what she is doing? The chemistry between Powell and Arjona is a pleasure to witness. Both actors bring out the best in one another and it is thrilling.Off-beat is an expression that would certainly apply to Hit Man - and it is a compliment. It is also one of the most enjoyable and fun 2 hours I've had in the cinema in the past few years. I absolutely adore this film.",

There were no flashes of actual connection beyond sexual intensity and discussion about murder. It would've been nice to see them have at least one \"get to know you\" interaction outside of the sex-murder dichotomy.The ending is also.... Unnecessary.

There is no doubt that Hit Man is a fun, maybe even entertaining, film at times. Seeing the magnificent Glenn Powell navigate the different personas he create for himself with considerable ease and suaveness is a great joy. But while this undercover average Joe turned hit-man idea may serve as an interesting premise, the film does not develop much from this premise meaningfully. The plot is overly slight, and the direction it goes is bizarre, especially the ending, which felt rushed and contrived. The plot does not develop in a manner which extracts full potential of comedy from its situation, and neither is it particularly entertaining. Also, Despite what some critics have praised, I could not see much chemistry between Arjona and Powell. Sure, they are both more than serviceable in their roles, and they share several steamy scenes, but there is no special spark or unique connection between the two. At the end of the day, I find Hit Man very similar to The Fall Guy, a movie released at around the same time. Both are serviceable, fun, and entertaining distractions which can barely hold and audiences attention for two hours. But both are overly light on actual plot, are only mildly entertaining, and not as funny or enjoyable as they should have been.",

        "description": "My first experience with Glenn Powell was his supporting role in Top Gun: Maverick. He's been around much longer but he was good at playing the brash and cocky Hangman. He's been noteworthy in previous efforts (Hidden Figures was also mentioned by one of my friends) but I was blown away by his work in Hit Man, not only is he fantastic as the suave and smooth Ron but he's also convincing as the reserved and stale Gary (I do have some thoughts on how they present Gary, more on that later). But watching him in Hit Man, it felt like I was watching someone doing acting gymnastics, he's playing so many different and bizarre characters and he nailed every single one. He also has great chemistry with his co-star Adria Arjona, I was just as interested in the their torrid romance than I was in what costume Gary was going to shuffle into next. Speaking of Adria, her work in this was also noteworthy, it would have been easy to make assumptions about Madison's character if Adria's performance didn't make her so mysterious and alluring. She's beautiful, she got her fair share of laughs from me and I was surprised at how invested I was in Gary and Madison's relationship by the end of the movie. I also wanted to credit Austin Amelio, Retta and Sanjay Rao for their collective work in their supporting parts. Another expectation the movie subverts is painting Jasper as a two dimensional villain, Austin makes Jasper unlikeable but not inhuman or not believable as Gary's dejected co-worker.Besides the performances, my favourite part of Hit Man was how it subverts the formula. I can't call it wholly and completely original but I was constantly trying to guess the next twist or shift in the narrative based on similar films. Hit Man continued to zag when I expected it to zig and it's so well layered. Director Richard Linklater and his team have a sense of when they need to switch things up, just when the movie gets too goofy, we get more time with Ron & Madison bonding or when you're about to guess when a twist will happen, the movie will suddenly get much darker. There's several tones at play but they are mixed together so precisely that it kept me entertained when I feel like another movie would have lost me.So many movies are \"based\" on a true story and sure enough, Hit Man isn't the unvarnished truth up on the screen. But the movie is cognizant of the fatigue that comes with this claim and admits it upfront. It helps that the true story is so fantastical that I wasn't bothered in how they tweaked it. Despite the changes, Hit Man is so good natured and seems to being celebrating Gary's unbelievable skill set that I didn't get bogged down in what was true and what wasn't.Hit Man slowly builds toward the finale and despite climax being morally murkier and darker tinged than I maybe expected, I loved how the ending punctuated what was a hugely enjoyable film. I was rooting for Gary/Ron and Madison despite what was revealed about them and it's captured wonderfully by Linklater. The movie doesn't pause to scold you for being sympathetic to one party or another and I liked that it wasn't too concerned with the absolute morality of the characters. The film ends with a metaphorical wink to the audience and it felt like a chef's kiss on a delicious meal.I'm going to be brief about any griping, My only problem is that they don't do a wholly convincing job of dressing Glen Powell down to be the nerdy and shy Gary Johnson when he's just being himself. It's reminiscent of sitcoms slapping glasses on models to trying to present them as dowdy. When everyone is making jokes about how \"normal\" and \"unassuming\" Gary looks, I rolled my eyes a little. But I guess Glen Powell being too handsome to be terribly convincing as a geek college professor is a nice problem to have.Hit Man was such a pleasant surprise, I felt like I was taking a gamble taking friends to see it in the theatre with me but we all walked out impressed. It made me a little sad that it was simultaneously released on Netflix, this is a theatre quality movie and while I understand it might have had a tougher road to profitability than your typical summer tentpole, it earned my ticket price. The film is so much fun, Glen Powell and Adria Arjona light up the screen and the fact that it's based on a true story is just delightful (I loved the end credits joke on how they changed the story). I tip my hat to Powell, Linklater & his team and the real Gary Johnson, I had a great time with Hit Man. I'd rate this at an 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9/10 and while you should check it out on Netflix, you won't regret going to see it in theatres either.",

        "description": "Richard Linklater's (Before Sunrise trilogy, Boyhood) latest film is getting very good reviews so it's quite a surprise once you see it that it's average at best. One of the reasons for that is the lack of variety and emotion Glen Powell puts in (or doesn't) in his performance. There should be a duality between his build-up cocky Ron hit man persona and Gary, his softer, nerdier, normal day-to-day self. Yet, when he supposedly switches between one and the other there's no real substantial difference between the two besides a cosmetic one. One would think this would be the role to show his acting prowess but there seems to be very little and this is nowhere near Bryan Cranston's duality performance skills as Walter White in Breaking Bad if we were to compare an actors task of switching between two sides of a character.There's never any palpable tension in Gary/Ron, he's always in control. He's in control when he becomes the face of the supposed hit-man for the first time (no nervousness, nothing), he is in control when everything starts to unravel, he's in control when he's being confronted with his actions during the climax of the film, and so on - and the film suffers very much from it as we never go along with the main character or actually worry about him, as the main actor never really does anything with it.Likewise, it's a bit boring at times, the cinematography is beyond plain and it's very predictable. The film would have been so much better had it been more stylised, with a more substantial visual flair and a cool soundtrack at least to cover its flaws, since overall there's not really much meat to the story and the film ends up being about nothing.",

No local flavor from the the setting, which is weird - why choose NOLA then never use it in any way that enhances the film? The story is absurd and really very inane. Nothing in this is slightly funny, and it becomes witty and actually engaging for exactly one scene. The rest of this is borderline awful. The actor is smarmy and kind of a cross between Ryan Gosling and Christian Slater - neither of whom are all that great on their own. The situations shown are ridiculous and always look 100% scripted and nothing whatsoever like the way life on this planet actually occurs. The first entire 2/3 of this is a slog and a jumble of implausible and boring events, the it rises very slightly and briefly when the aforementioned One Good Scene occurs, only to divebomb very hard into a completely incomprehensibly ruinous ending. Bad storytelling, bad direction, bad script, The actors do their jobs well, but with so little to work with. A truly lightweight piece of product from an \"artist\" director. Not a proud moment for him, not in the slightest.",

There are maybe three other male actors right now in this category: George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt. Powell makes this movie work, his easygoing affability papers over the movie's contrivances and wobbly morality, and distracts from Linklater's bland, almost TV-movie like set-ups and blocking. Linklater's best films-Slacker, the Before Trilogy, Boyhood-present a consistent visual style, but most of his work is interchangeable with any number of directors-for-hire.",

The reality is this is just another Rom-Com film with critics falling head-over-heels with Linklater (as they always do). The most interesting part of the film is actually the first act, when Glen Powell gets to shine in a diverse portfolio of characters, including a long, gritty dialogue exchange. By the time the love interest appears in the second act, the film has already fallen into just another collage of good cop/good person/bad circumstance entanglement. Unfortunately the film never really redeems itself, nor its characters in unforgiveable acts. Its story feels mundane and outcome certain.

His latest is HIT MAN, which is a romantic comedy that's very loosely based on an article about a real guy, Gary Johnson. Gary (Glen Powell) is a college professor and part-time staffer at the New Orleans Police Department. He stumbles into a new role as an undercover hitman, arresting people who try hiring him to kill someone. It turns out he's very good at it. Powell really showcases his talents here, playing different characters for each arrest. When he meets Madison (Adria Arjona) though, he breaks protocol. I guess Powell has great chemistry with whoever he works with. He has an undeniable charm that seems like it spreads to the whole cast. I could tell they had fun filming this. It also has a very smart script, playing with ideas of identity and being your true self. The strong sense of humour actually changes as the movie progresses, which was fun for me, but might not work for some. I find it hilarious that they must've asked the real Gary Johnson for permission to go as far as they do here. The movie makes it clear what actually happened during the end credits. HIT MAN is quirky, unconventional, and very enjoyable. If you can't see it in theaters, don't worry! It'll be on Netflix June 7th. Make sure the algorithm doesn't bury it. Enjoy!",

        "date": "7 October 2023",
        "description": "Hitman is definitely a film-lover's paradise but even the casual film viewer will thoroughly enjoy this brilliant new movie. Linklater's latest lovingly pays homage to film noir, screwball comedy, Hitchcockian black comedy and even the good old psychosexual drama but it still somehow manages to conjure up a fresh, witty and often uproarious confection that frequently teases, delights and occasionally thrills the audience with frissons of excitement, keeping them enraptured all the way to its deliciously razor sharp ending.This is potentially a star-making turn for Glen Powell. Although he made a strong impression in Top Gun: Maverick as a cocky rival pilot, his role in Hit Man is easily more complex and, as the co-writer of the script, he has been able to add brilliant layers to his character, or should that be characters? In effect, Powell is playing more than one character - Gary Johnson, mild-mannered, cat-loving geeky Psychology professor and audio techie who moonlights as a surveillance expert for a Louisana-based police unit that targets and stings hapless ne'er-do-wells who are looking to hire a killer. Before the next sting operation, Gary's police colleague Jasper (Austin Amelio) who normally pretends to be the hired killer is suspended for brutally attacking two youths, which forces Gary's colleagues (brilliantly played by Retta and Sanjay Rao) into convincing Gary to take over from the universally loathed Jasper, much to Gary's dismay. Yet, within minutes of taking on the task, Gary suddenly morphs into \"Ron\" and during his first sting he is so convincing that his colleagues are shocked, even though they had believed he could do it having heard Jasper go through the rigamarole on previous occasions. It is a brilliant piece of acting.Having created the killer persona, Gary soon finds himself becoming more and more immersed in Ron, adding further, chameleon-like layers of disguise and character traits to mirror whoever is about to be stung. However, things become really complicated (in true film noir style) when \"Ron\" is approached by a femme fatale, Maddy (beautifully played by Adria Ajrona who also adds a delightfully a kooky sexy edge as well as a tender vulnerability). As the sparks between the two begin to fly during a hilarious but flirty exchange, Gary, who is clearly enjoying himself as Ron, finds himself conflicted. Dare he. As Ron, continue with the sting and have Maddy arrested for plotting to murder her husband? Has the flirtatious exchange caused Maddy to betray some regrets about what she is doing? The chemistry between Powell and Arjona is a pleasure to witness. Both actors bring out the best in one another and it is thrilling.Off-beat is an expression that would certainly apply to Hit Man - and it is a compliment. It is also one of the most enjoyable and fun 2 hours I've had in the cinema in the past few years. I absolutely adore this film.",

There is no doubt that Hit Man is a fun, maybe even entertaining, film at times. Seeing the magnificent Glenn Powell navigate the different personas he create for himself with considerable ease and suaveness is a great joy. But while this undercover average Joe turned hit-man idea may serve as an interesting premise, the film does not develop much from this premise meaningfully. The plot is overly slight, and the direction it goes is bizarre, especially the ending, which felt rushed and contrived. The plot does not develop in a manner which extracts full potential of comedy from its situation, and neither is it particularly entertaining. Also, Despite what some critics have praised, I could not see much chemistry between Arjona and Powell. Sure, they are both more than serviceable in their roles, and they share several steamy scenes, but there is no special spark or unique connection between the two. At the end of the day, I find Hit Man very similar to The Fall Guy, a movie released at around the same time. Both are serviceable, fun, and entertaining distractions which can barely hold and audiences attention for two hours. But both are overly light on actual plot, are only mildly entertaining, and not as funny or enjoyable as they should have been.",

        "description": "My first experience with Glenn Powell was his supporting role in Top Gun: Maverick. He's been around much longer but he was good at playing the brash and cocky Hangman. He's been noteworthy in previous efforts (Hidden Figures was also mentioned by one of my friends) but I was blown away by his work in Hit Man, not only is he fantastic as the suave and smooth Ron but he's also convincing as the reserved and stale Gary (I do have some thoughts on how they present Gary, more on that later). But watching him in Hit Man, it felt like I was watching someone doing acting gymnastics, he's playing so many different and bizarre characters and he nailed every single one. He also has great chemistry with his co-star Adria Arjona, I was just as interested in the their torrid romance than I was in what costume Gary was going to shuffle into next. Speaking of Adria, her work in this was also noteworthy, it would have been easy to make assumptions about Madison's character if Adria's performance didn't make her so mysterious and alluring. She's beautiful, she got her fair share of laughs from me and I was surprised at how invested I was in Gary and Madison's relationship by the end of the movie. I also wanted to credit Austin Amelio, Retta and Sanjay Rao for their collective work in their supporting parts. Another expectation the movie subverts is painting Jasper as a two dimensional villain, Austin makes Jasper unlikeable but not inhuman or not believable as Gary's dejected co-worker.Besides the performances, my favourite part of Hit Man was how it subverts the formula. I can't call it wholly and completely original but I was constantly trying to guess the next twist or shift in the narrative based on similar films. Hit Man continued to zag when I expected it to zig and it's so well layered. Director Richard Linklater and his team have a sense of when they need to switch things up, just when the movie gets too goofy, we get more time with Ron & Madison bonding or when you're about to guess when a twist will happen, the movie will suddenly get much darker. There's several tones at play but they are mixed together so precisely that it kept me entertained when I feel like another movie would have lost me.So many movies are \"based\" on a true story and sure enough, Hit Man isn't the unvarnished truth up on the screen. But the movie is cognizant of the fatigue that comes with this claim and admits it upfront. It helps that the true story is so fantastical that I wasn't bothered in how they tweaked it. Despite the changes, Hit Man is so good natured and seems to being celebrating Gary's unbelievable skill set that I didn't get bogged down in what was true and what wasn't.Hit Man slowly builds toward the finale and despite climax being morally murkier and darker tinged than I maybe expected, I loved how the ending punctuated what was a hugely enjoyable film. I was rooting for Gary/Ron and Madison despite what was revealed about them and it's captured wonderfully by Linklater. The movie doesn't pause to scold you for being sympathetic to one party or another and I liked that it wasn't too concerned with the absolute morality of the characters. The film ends with a metaphorical wink to the audience and it felt like a chef's kiss on a delicious meal.I'm going to be brief about any griping, My only problem is that they don't do a wholly convincing job of dressing Glen Powell down to be the nerdy and shy Gary Johnson when he's just being himself. It's reminiscent of sitcoms slapping glasses on models to trying to present them as dowdy. When everyone is making jokes about how \"normal\" and \"unassuming\" Gary looks, I rolled my eyes a little. But I guess Glen Powell being too handsome to be terribly convincing as a geek college professor is a nice problem to have.Hit Man was such a pleasant surprise, I felt like I was taking a gamble taking friends to see it in the theatre with me but we all walked out impressed. It made me a little sad that it was simultaneously released on Netflix, this is a theatre quality movie and while I understand it might have had a tougher road to profitability than your typical summer tentpole, it earned my ticket price. The film is so much fun, Glen Powell and Adria Arjona light up the screen and the fact that it's based on a true story is just delightful (I loved the end credits joke on how they changed the story). I tip my hat to Powell, Linklater & his team and the real Gary Johnson, I had a great time with Hit Man. I'd rate this at an 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9/10 and while you should check it out on Netflix, you won't regret going to see it in theatres either.",

        "description": "Richard Linklater's (Before Sunrise trilogy, Boyhood) latest film is getting very good reviews so it's quite a surprise once you see it that it's average at best. One of the reasons for that is the lack of variety and emotion Glen Powell puts in (or doesn't) in his performance. There should be a duality between his build-up cocky Ron hit man persona and Gary, his softer, nerdier, normal day-to-day self. Yet, when he supposedly switches between one and the other there's no real substantial difference between the two besides a cosmetic one. One would think this would be the role to show his acting prowess but there seems to be very little and this is nowhere near Bryan Cranston's duality performance skills as Walter White in Breaking Bad if we were to compare an actors task of switching between two sides of a character.There's never any palpable tension in Gary/Ron, he's always in control. He's in control when he becomes the face of the supposed hit-man for the first time (no nervousness, nothing), he is in control when everything starts to unravel, he's in control when he's being confronted with his actions during the climax of the film, and so on - and the film suffers very much from it as we never go along with the main character or actually worry about him, as the main actor never really does anything with it.Likewise, it's a bit boring at times, the cinematography is beyond plain and it's very predictable. The film would have been so much better had it been more stylised, with a more substantial visual flair and a cool soundtrack at least to cover its flaws, since overall there's not really much meat to the story and the film ends up being about nothing.",

The chemistry is good, their relationship portrayal is sexy and entertaining to watch but I do think the movie kinda drag on. There is no action or some set pieces, but it is pretty funny. It is not a bad movie at all but they really did cross the line morally lol.Honestly, I thought Ron (Glen Powell) would be a serial killer. He has the look and the wtf script he churned out during his interrogation. I think its just a funny twist if he turned out be a serial killer that just off bad people as a hobby. Like dexter. But some bits of the movie won't work.Overall, not a bad movie but kinda lacking something. But Glen Powell is amazing and I will support him and whatever movie he would be in.",

Nothing in this is slightly funny, and it becomes witty and actually engaging for exactly one scene. The rest of this is borderline awful. The actor is smarmy and kind of a cross between Ryan Gosling and Christian Slater - neither of whom are all that great on their own. The situations shown are ridiculous and always look 100% scripted and nothing whatsoever like the way life on this planet actually occurs. The first entire 2/3 of this is a slog and a jumble of implausible and boring events, the it rises very slightly and briefly when the aforementioned One Good Scene occurs, only to divebomb very hard into a completely incomprehensibly ruinous ending. Bad storytelling, bad direction, bad script, The actors do their jobs well, but with so little to work with. A truly lightweight piece of product from an \"artist\" director.

We as a viewer saw no romantic or loving conversations in which they got to know each other better and I suppose that's part of the story with Gary being a supposed hitman and all, but it just makes the eventual romance seem sudden and odd.She then decides to drug a cop(!) in her own house(!!), Gary's just okay with it, finishes the job and it just fades into another sex scene and then fast forwards to where they have a happy family. You're telling me they killed a cop on the spot without any planning and alibis and got away with it? I really didn't expect this so called action comedy to end like that.",

        "date": "9 June 2024",
        "description": "\"Hitman,\" directed by Richard Linklater, is an intriguing yet uneven journey that offers glimpses of potential but ultimately falls short of being a memorable cinematic experience. Based on a true story, the film features commendable performances, particularly from Glen Powell, but suffers from a lack of character development and emotional depth.Glen Powell delivers a standout performance, embodying his character with a mix of charm and authenticity that makes him a compelling figure to watch. His nuanced portrayal brings a layer of believability to the narrative, making the moments of action and subtle humor particularly enjoyable. Powell's ability to infuse his role with both intensity and a touch of levity is one of the film's highlights.The movie does offer a few humorous moments that provide a welcome break from the otherwise serious tone. These lighter scenes are well-executed and add a layer of entertainment, making the film a decent choice for those looking for a casual watch. However, the humor alone is not enough to compensate for the film's more significant shortcomings.One of the primary issues with \"Hitman\" is its lack of character development. Despite the film being based on a true story, the characters feel underdeveloped and one-dimensional. There is a noticeable absence of emotional depth, which makes it difficult for the audience to connect with or care about the characters on a deeper level. This lack of character growth and exploration is a missed opportunity that could have elevated the film from being merely good to something truly impactful.Richard Linklater's direction, while competent, fails to fully capitalize on the story's potential. The narrative feels rushed at times, and the pacing issues detract from the overall impact of the film. There are moments that hint at deeper emotional and psychological layers, but these are never fully explored, leaving the audience with a sense of incompleteness.In conclusion, \"Hitman\" is a film that is good for passing the time but doesn't leave a lasting impression. Glen Powell's strong performance and the film's occasional humor make it worth a watch, but the lack of character development and emotional depth prevent it from being anything more than a mildly entertaining diversion. With a more nuanced approach to storytelling and character development, \"Hitman\" could have been much more impactful.",

I had seen some movies he has a role in, but as he has been more of a character actor, I wasn't really aware of him. Here, he can kind of use that. He is supposed to be forgettable and learn to be something else.Powell also co-wrote the movie, his first feature as the writer. The story is nothing special.

'Hit Man' somehow achieves the opposite - it's a fluffy confection inspired by the real-life exploits of a psychology professor who masquerades a professional hit man while moonlighting for the police department. Gary Johnson carries out this pretense in order to entrap those looking to hire an assassin.The film's introductory sequences show restaurant encounters where he convinces several would-be murderers he's a hardened criminal in the liquidation business. These meetings are recorded, and the conspirators arrested after clearly stating their intent and handing over a down-payment. Linklater's narrative departs from reality when a beautiful Latina asks him to terminate her abusive husband. To the confusion of his handlers, Gary refuses her payment, and suggests she initiate divorce proceedings instead of contracting a homicide. Needless to say, complications ensue when he secretly starts an affair with her while maintaining his killer-for-hire persona.'Hit Man' could have followed in the footsteps of modern classics like 'Body Heat', but Linklater chooses to play it for light comedy rather than drama. Tension is lost as the proceedings become increasingly frivolous and unlikely. The acting performances and amusing screenplay just about hold one's interest, but the end-result feels like an insubstantial appetizer that could have been a memorable main course with a different approach.",

Later, they meet up and start an affair, but she thinks it's with a hit man. Then her husband dies in an alley.Richard Linklater's movie is not just a good black comedy. It's also a statement about the current belief that you can change who you are by changing what you do. Intellectually it's a bit of a straw man argument in this movie, but it's a story, not a balanced lecture. If it was good enough for George Bernard Shaw, it's good enough for Linklater.",

        "description": "The hitman is already for a long time a popular character in crime and (neo) noir films. For me the ultimate hitman-film is \"The day of the jackal\" (1973, Fred Zinnemann). In this film Edward Fox plays a hitman that is professional, emotionless and a typical loner.Only the last description does apply to Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) in \"The hit man\". He is however not a real hit man but an undercover hit man. He meets people looking for a hit man and makes sure the compromising evidence is on tape.In order to do this he changes outfit all the time and this leads to a comic costume parade, including an imitation of Anton Chigur (Javier Bardem), the hit man from \"No country for old men\" (2007, Ethan & Joel Coen).Being partly a comedy, \"Hit man\" is an odd one in the oeuvre of director Richard Linklater, who is mostly known for his \"Before .... \" relation trilogy (1995, 2004,2013) and his coming of age film \"Boyhood\" (2014).\"Hit man\" really takes of when Gary Johnson falls in love with one of his clients (Maddy Masters played by Adria Arjona). It is the starting point of a roller coaster of numerous unexpected twists and turns.One of the themes is losing sight of the difference between your undercover \"me\" and your real \"me\". It happens in numerous film, but it also happens in reality. In an investigation from 1994 - 1996 the Dutch parliament studied how it happened by the police while combatting organized crime.The fact is however that Gary Johnson has two real \"me's\", one as a part-time police officer and one as a professor in philosophy. The last one delivers the philosophical theme of the movie of how to find a satisfactory balance between ratio and discipline (represented by the Greek God Apollo) and feeling, emotions, instincts and living dangerously (represented by the Greek God Dionysus).Remarkable is that where his most famous films (The \"Before\" trilogy and \"Boyhood\") are typical for an Apollonian world, \"Hit man\" descends to the depths of Dionysus.By the way, \"Hitman\" is in my opinion not very flattering for women, showing how they prefer the sex appeal of a hit man to that of a \"dull\" police officer (let alone a nerdy professor).",

When one of their investigators \"Jasper\" (Austin Amelio) goes a bit too far and gets suspended, Gary gets drafted in last minute and proves quite effective at getting folks who want to bump of their nearest and dearest for $5,000 to admit their cunning plans to a well wired-up con. The more of these cases he does, the better he gets; the more fun he has dressing up and adept he becomes at assuming a range of identities. It's \"Maddy\" (Adria Arjona) who sets the cat amongst the pigeons when she asks him to get shot of her thuggish husband \"Ray\" (Evan Holtzman). He takes a shine to her and talks her out of her criminal ploy. Quickly the two are seeing each other - which is manna from heaven for the deposed \"Jasper\". When her husband is found dead, he thinks he knows exactly who did what and how best to exact his revenge... It's quite an entertaining romantic thriller this, providing Powell with an opportunity to charm his way through an almost two hours of cinema that is light and fluffy, completely preposterous yet based on a true character.

Everything ok, until here still a mildly entertaining movie.The problem however is the third act. It's difficult to describe the issue without spoilers so here they come:\nMaddy's husband is dead. It turns out she has killed him. As the investigation shows, a recent life insurance policy could be motive. Gary is sent in to get a confession from Maddy. Instead that he is actively guiding her by providing her with clues how to appear innocent in the exchange.A bit problematic, but hey, this is not a documentary, it's fiction.But of course one of the cops figured out, that it was Maddy who killed her husband and now tries to blackmail her for some of the insurance money. Her solution to the problem: spiking his bottled beer (how?) so he gets unconscious while blackmailing Maddy and Gary. Gary's solution, as drugging a cop does not have the best looks: Killing the cop, obviously.And then, they live happily ever after.So we summarize: Maddy kills her husband probably for the insurance money, Gary covers it up by murdering a cop. Followed by a happy end. Shall this really be the moral of the story? I have my difficulties with that.",

Instead of trying to make it seem like all the events in the movie happened in real life in a deceiving manner, Hit Man, based on a real person, openly states the inaccuracies in the movie that are much different from real life events. I find various movies these days don't offer this type of respect to real people or events and the idea of adding fantasy elements and blending them with reality results in some people believing it entirely. This results in a different view towards certain real people and events, which is all just very manipulative and upsetting. While this isn't really that big of an issue (except when it's done a problematic way, such as disrespecting loss of life, tragedy, etc.) but I really do appreciate Hit Man's honesty about it.

First, the pacing. The first hour or so is slow and monotonous. With scenes being repeated as if the film is trying to prove a point, but doesn't actually add anything to the overall character / narrative. Secondly, the film tries too hard to fit in a bunch of different genres and tropes. Is it a rom-com? Sometimes. Is it a dark comedy? I guess. Is it a movie which asks existential questions whilst exploring that theme with the characters? It tries to. Unfortunately it all just mixes into a big pile of bleh.

It's the kind of story that, much like Edgar Wright's Baby Driver or Shaun of the Dead, would've made for a mediocre movie if directed by an amateur, but made for a great movie because it was directed by an experienced industry professional. All Linklater films are good films.This film keeps you guessing from beginning to end and tells its story in a way that makes the audience feel like they are learning and growing along with the characters. A great example of this is when the film periodically cuts back to Glen Powell's character, Gary Johnson, lecturing students on the everyday behaviors of people. Gary casually and subtly uses his experience as an undercover investigator as the building blocks for these lessons. By doing this, Gary is also introducing and breaking down the overarching themes of the film. It truly is brilliant storytelling.There will never be enough words to properly commend the actors in this film. They brought so much life and enthusiasm to their characters in constant battle between show stealers. In this battle, there were no winners or losers. The acting was balanced and cast members complimented their costars exquisitely.Linklater and Powell's writing was entertaining, truly comedic, well paced, and extremely thoughtful.

At one point he has to play a fake hitman with the police. He is hired by clients to commit murders, but after clients confess their criminal plans to Gary, the police can arrest them.When Madison Masters (Adria Arjona) wants to hire Gary, he falls for her beauty. This causes him to break his own rules and try to change Madison's mind so that she does not carry out criminal plans. The two fall in love, but Madison actually falls for the hitman Ron, who played Gary for her. On the other hand, Gary shouldn't show that he's broken his own code to Madison because it could get him in trouble with the police and ruin his career.This film is based on a true story, where the real Gary Johnson posed himself to the police as a hitman who criminals could hire to commit murders. Only after sharing their murderous plans with Gary could the police catch them. The real Gary Johnson had to dress up so many times, wearing different styles of clothes and wigs to appear different to each criminal, so he couldn't be exposed as an undercover cop. Glen Powell also does the same at the beginning of the film. He wears different costumes and also acts in different ways. For example, the film starts off more like an action comedy, but when Gary falls for Madison, the film turns more into a romantic comedy.Richard Linklater provides a comic action film, but with repeated events, where Gary, in different disguises, makes various criminals confess. When the film later turns more into a romantic comedy, this mainly works because of the good chemistry between Glen Powell and Adria Arjona, their characters. Glen Powell only plays a character who leads a double life and his character ends up in a relationship with the possible criminal. This creates complicated situations in which he has to continue working strategically, without Madison or the police realizing that he is actually lying to both of them. However, the film does have a somewhat abrupt ending, which does not seem to answer everything.Glen Powell plays the lead role well and actually has to play the role in different ways. This gives him the opportunity to show different acting capabilities in this film. Adria Arjona also plays the role of a seductive, possible criminal well, because as a viewer, like the main characters, you do not always know whether she can be completely trusted. After his time in various Walking Dead series, Austin Amelio also gets the chance to act in a film. He plays a colleague of the main character, who may thwart his strategic plans if he is told too much.",

He's able to play a fun variety of hit men, but that isn't really the central focus. Adria Arjona is pretty good at the love interest with what could best be described as innocently dark intentions.The jokes from many of the side characters didn't really work for me, most notably Gary's two police associates, played by Retta and Sanjay Rao. There seemed to be some kind of underlying message about how we're all capable of change in one way or another, but I feel like that was included to justify the surprisingly dark yet underwhelming ending this movie pulls.Overall, there's not much to say about Hit Man, aside from being an occasionally darkly humorous and empty movie that you'd put on when you don't want to think too hard.",

That's it.The movie had a slow build up, giving u insight bout the undercover work Gary was doing and it is a noble cause, stopping a crime but from the moment the romantic lead entered, the movie derailed. And the ending kinda took out all the good things (however much measly amount they were) away for sure. Because these things surely will give hope to someone that u can get away from a wrong doing and live happily ever after.As for acting, Glen really has the unreadable face with one or two expressions which worked in his favor in this movie. But Adria. You know those actresses in B or C grade movies where their acts immediately tell u they are fishy and acting and with no subtlety trying to pry information outta u and batting eyelashes to make u do something, her acting in this movie belongs in that category. Anytime she was on screen, i had to endure a fake performance.There was barely any action, any comedy and romantic romance, so defining which genre this one belongs to is hard. But calling it a Rom-Com will be a huge disservice to the genre and insult to the original Rom-Coms.",

Plus it is based loosely on a true story, which I usually find elevates my interest.That said, it isn't going to blow you away, doesn't do anything new and isn't particularly memorable. I can't fault the performances, and it is a fun enjoyable watch, which is worth viewing at home. I did get a bit of an insight into a whole 'world' of detective work that is legal and I was shocked by how scarily common it is for a spouse, or disgruntled friend/relation/colleague/rival to attempt to set up a hitman to kill.Having since read a bit about the guy upon whom this film's main character is based, his 'success' is undeniable. The parallel lives he led is impressive and fascinating. The statistics we are given on screen are accurate. But, it does become rather a farfetched plot and in some cases of 'based on true events' films I've really felt 'truth can be stranger/more wild than fiction '.However, in the case of Hitman, the twists and turns the story takes are fictional, and discovering this was slightly disappointing but I guess it also makes me feel they did a good job at using a true character and expanding/fleshing out an entertaining yarn!I'd love to see a documentary on this guy, and/or a different director/filmmakers create a more serious, exploration of him or other people who work undercover, and the impact this has upon their psyche, relationships, and the type of person who can actually live a life like this.",

One thing leads to another and things go wrong and that makes the rest of this 'dark-thriller comedy' story.This seems like a couple friends having an idea, coming up with the screenplay, one directs and produces it and the other acts in it. This is what you'd come up with your friend, nothing over the top but still entertaining enough.While there's nothing GREAT about it, the writing and the chemistry between Glen and Adria sell the film well.

        "description": "\"The eternal mystery of human consciousness and behavior.\" Gary Johnson (Glen Powell)Having just enjoyed a summer stroll through an arts festival, I settled for another breezy summer evening with Glen Powell as a nerdy and hot professor and hitman, thanks to the Netflix trick of playing its crime soft and its romance, well, plainly romantic.Promising some truth in the telling, Hitman is based on a feature in Texas Monthly about Gary Johnson, a college philosophy teacher (see the above quote about his interest) who also moonlights with the local police as an ersatz hitman, nailing scores of bad apples looking to hire an assassin usually for reasons of love gone badly. Gary, wearing multiple disguises for his wildly different clients, can further enhance his lectures on the self: \"What if your self is a construct?\" he asks his students.Gary remains an operative who never kills anyone until he meets comely client, Maddy (Adria Arjona), and is drawn into a caper as Ron and lover, possibly becoming at least an accomplice to murder. Meanwhile, director Richard Linklater, who knows a thing or two about actors as lovers, weaves the romance with college lectures on identity and psychological self-styling, common threads in our social-media landscape. Our ability to create our own persona on Facebook or Snapchat, for example, is not unlike his profession, but not quite as dangerous, mostly.You don't need to know Nietzsche to believe that a mild-mannered professor could play a hit man (a student exclaims, \"When did our teacher get hot?\") or that anyone could construct a personality with the help of the Internet. The film becomes more than an amusing thriller as identities play a key role in furthering a promising romance or solving a crime that has murder as a centerpiece.Although more than once it's claimed there are no hitmen now or in history, Hit Man goes a long way in convincing us that they could be real. In more than one extended dialogue, Gary/Ron explains the complexity and allure of switching identities.Hit Man has its own double identity-cool summer caper and dangerous romance, both threatened by electronic surveillance and the human capability of shifting its persona throughout life. Although the subject of identity crafting involving the id, the ego, and the superego can't be adequately discussed in a brief TV melodrama, Hit Man does give one pause. And a brisk summer breeze.",

The script is funny, the cast is solid, and the chemistry between Powell and Arjona Is palpable.

First the obvious, is it a good story that people want to hear. Check. Secondly, for screenplays a story should have a certain flow about it since the audience will not be using their imagination to visualize said story. This is where Hit Man really shines. It simultaneously leads the audience effortlessly, from one plot point to the next all while throwing curve balls the whole way so we don't know where to look. Truly a fun ride to take.The acting is good on all fronts with special nod to Glen for having fun with multiple characters. Not much negative to discuss. Hit Man does drag a bit in the middle after starting strong but finishes even stronger. That is the key to rewatchability I think, a strong finish.

Linklater's latest lovingly pays homage to film noir, screwball comedy, Hitchcockian black comedy and even the good old psychosexual drama but it still somehow manages to conjure up a fresh, witty and often uproarious confection that frequently teases, delights and occasionally thrills the audience with frissons of excitement, keeping them enraptured all the way to its deliciously razor sharp ending.This is potentially a star-making turn for Glen Powell. Although he made a strong impression in Top Gun: Maverick as a cocky rival pilot, his role in Hit Man is easily more complex and, as the co-writer of the script, he has been able to add brilliant layers to his character, or should that be characters? In effect, Powell is playing more than one character - Gary Johnson, mild-mannered, cat-loving geeky Psychology professor and audio techie who moonlights as a surveillance expert for a Louisana-based police unit that targets and stings hapless ne'er-do-wells who are looking to hire a killer. Before the next sting operation, Gary's police colleague Jasper (Austin Amelio) who normally pretends to be the hired killer is suspended for brutally attacking two youths, which forces Gary's colleagues (brilliantly played by Retta and Sanjay Rao) into convincing Gary to take over from the universally loathed Jasper, much to Gary's dismay. Yet, within minutes of taking on the task, Gary suddenly morphs into \"Ron\" and during his first sting he is so convincing that his colleagues are shocked, even though they had believed he could do it having heard Jasper go through the rigamarole on previous occasions. It is a brilliant piece of acting.Having created the killer persona, Gary soon finds himself becoming more and more immersed in Ron, adding further, chameleon-like layers of disguise and character traits to mirror whoever is about to be stung. However, things become really complicated (in true film noir style) when \"Ron\" is approached by a femme fatale, Maddy (beautifully played by Adria Ajrona who also adds a delightfully a kooky sexy edge as well as a tender vulnerability). As the sparks between the two begin to fly during a hilarious but flirty exchange, Gary, who is clearly enjoying himself as Ron, finds himself conflicted. Dare he. As Ron, continue with the sting and have Maddy arrested for plotting to murder her husband? Has the flirtatious exchange caused Maddy to betray some regrets about what she is doing? The chemistry between Powell and Arjona is a pleasure to witness. Both actors bring out the best in one another and it is thrilling.Off-beat is an expression that would certainly apply to Hit Man - and it is a compliment. It is also one of the most enjoyable and fun 2 hours I've had in the cinema in the past few years. I absolutely adore this film.",

Also, Despite what some critics have praised, I could not see much chemistry between Arjona and Powell. Sure, they are both more than serviceable in their roles, and they share several steamy scenes, but there is no special spark or unique connection between the two. At the end of the day, I find Hit Man very similar to The Fall Guy, a movie released at around the same time. Both are serviceable, fun, and entertaining distractions which can barely hold and audiences attention for two hours. But both are overly light on actual plot, are only mildly entertaining, and not as funny or enjoyable as they should have been.",

It is more Psychological than Comedy, and it is is more Romance than Action.It's not entirely \"hilarious\", and I was just thinking about how a movie can be this engrossing without \"adrenaline-fueled\" sequences at all.. But what it is, it's a tremendously well written and executed script. With plenty of memorable lines, unexpected \"commitment\", and even introspective lessons. Glen Powell is simply amazing in it. He's demonstrated a lot of charm, but we now got to see quite a bit of range as well. Even his disguises. The rest of the cast helps sell it. And the ending was quite satisfying, even if I didn't entirely expected it!The great pacing takes you along and you start to accept the path you are walking alongside these characters.

        "description": "My first experience with Glenn Powell was his supporting role in Top Gun: Maverick. He's been around much longer but he was good at playing the brash and cocky Hangman. He's been noteworthy in previous efforts (Hidden Figures was also mentioned by one of my friends) but I was blown away by his work in Hit Man, not only is he fantastic as the suave and smooth Ron but he's also convincing as the reserved and stale Gary (I do have some thoughts on how they present Gary, more on that later). But watching him in Hit Man, it felt like I was watching someone doing acting gymnastics, he's playing so many different and bizarre characters and he nailed every single one. He also has great chemistry with his co-star Adria Arjona, I was just as interested in the their torrid romance than I was in what costume Gary was going to shuffle into next. Speaking of Adria, her work in this was also noteworthy, it would have been easy to make assumptions about Madison's character if Adria's performance didn't make her so mysterious and alluring. She's beautiful, she got her fair share of laughs from me and I was surprised at how invested I was in Gary and Madison's relationship by the end of the movie. I also wanted to credit Austin Amelio, Retta and Sanjay Rao for their collective work in their supporting parts. Another expectation the movie subverts is painting Jasper as a two dimensional villain, Austin makes Jasper unlikeable but not inhuman or not believable as Gary's dejected co-worker.Besides the performances, my favourite part of Hit Man was how it subverts the formula. I can't call it wholly and completely original but I was constantly trying to guess the next twist or shift in the narrative based on similar films. Hit Man continued to zag when I expected it to zig and it's so well layered. Director Richard Linklater and his team have a sense of when they need to switch things up, just when the movie gets too goofy, we get more time with Ron & Madison bonding or when you're about to guess when a twist will happen, the movie will suddenly get much darker. There's several tones at play but they are mixed together so precisely that it kept me entertained when I feel like another movie would have lost me.So many movies are \"based\" on a true story and sure enough, Hit Man isn't the unvarnished truth up on the screen. But the movie is cognizant of the fatigue that comes with this claim and admits it upfront. It helps that the true story is so fantastical that I wasn't bothered in how they tweaked it. Despite the changes, Hit Man is so good natured and seems to being celebrating Gary's unbelievable skill set that I didn't get bogged down in what was true and what wasn't.Hit Man slowly builds toward the finale and despite climax being morally murkier and darker tinged than I maybe expected, I loved how the ending punctuated what was a hugely enjoyable film. I was rooting for Gary/Ron and Madison despite what was revealed about them and it's captured wonderfully by Linklater. The movie doesn't pause to scold you for being sympathetic to one party or another and I liked that it wasn't too concerned with the absolute morality of the characters. The film ends with a metaphorical wink to the audience and it felt like a chef's kiss on a delicious meal.I'm going to be brief about any griping, My only problem is that they don't do a wholly convincing job of dressing Glen Powell down to be the nerdy and shy Gary Johnson when he's just being himself. It's reminiscent of sitcoms slapping glasses on models to trying to present them as dowdy. When everyone is making jokes about how \"normal\" and \"unassuming\" Gary looks, I rolled my eyes a little. But I guess Glen Powell being too handsome to be terribly convincing as a geek college professor is a nice problem to have.Hit Man was such a pleasant surprise, I felt like I was taking a gamble taking friends to see it in the theatre with me but we all walked out impressed. It made me a little sad that it was simultaneously released on Netflix, this is a theatre quality movie and while I understand it might have had a tougher road to profitability than your typical summer tentpole, it earned my ticket price. The film is so much fun, Glen Powell and Adria Arjona light up the screen and the fact that it's based on a true story is just delightful (I loved the end credits joke on how they changed the story). I tip my hat to Powell, Linklater & his team and the real Gary Johnson, I had a great time with Hit Man. I'd rate this at an 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9/10 and while you should check it out on Netflix, you won't regret going to see it in theatres either.",

        "description": "Richard Linklater's (Before Sunrise trilogy, Boyhood) latest film is getting very good reviews so it's quite a surprise once you see it that it's average at best. One of the reasons for that is the lack of variety and emotion Glen Powell puts in (or doesn't) in his performance. There should be a duality between his build-up cocky Ron hit man persona and Gary, his softer, nerdier, normal day-to-day self. Yet, when he supposedly switches between one and the other there's no real substantial difference between the two besides a cosmetic one. One would think this would be the role to show his acting prowess but there seems to be very little and this is nowhere near Bryan Cranston's duality performance skills as Walter White in Breaking Bad if we were to compare an actors task of switching between two sides of a character.There's never any palpable tension in Gary/Ron, he's always in control. He's in control when he becomes the face of the supposed hit-man for the first time (no nervousness, nothing), he is in control when everything starts to unravel, he's in control when he's being confronted with his actions during the climax of the film, and so on - and the film suffers very much from it as we never go along with the main character or actually worry about him, as the main actor never really does anything with it.Likewise, it's a bit boring at times, the cinematography is beyond plain and it's very predictable. The film would have been so much better had it been more stylised, with a more substantial visual flair and a cool soundtrack at least to cover its flaws, since overall there's not really much meat to the story and the film ends up being about nothing.",

We as a viewer saw no romantic or loving conversations in which they got to know each other better and I suppose that's part of the story with Gary being a supposed hitman and all, but it just makes the eventual romance seem sudden and odd.She then decides to drug a cop(!) in her own house(!!), Gary's just okay with it, finishes the job and it just fades into another sex scene and then fast forwards to where they have a happy family. You're telling me they killed a cop on the spot without any planning and alibis and got away with it? I really didn't expect this so called action comedy to end like that.",

        "description": "\"Hitman,\" directed by Richard Linklater, is an intriguing yet uneven journey that offers glimpses of potential but ultimately falls short of being a memorable cinematic experience. Based on a true story, the film features commendable performances, particularly from Glen Powell, but suffers from a lack of character development and emotional depth.Glen Powell delivers a standout performance, embodying his character with a mix of charm and authenticity that makes him a compelling figure to watch. His nuanced portrayal brings a layer of believability to the narrative, making the moments of action and subtle humor particularly enjoyable. Powell's ability to infuse his role with both intensity and a touch of levity is one of the film's highlights.The movie does offer a few humorous moments that provide a welcome break from the otherwise serious tone. These lighter scenes are well-executed and add a layer of entertainment, making the film a decent choice for those looking for a casual watch. However, the humor alone is not enough to compensate for the film's more significant shortcomings.One of the primary issues with \"Hitman\" is its lack of character development. Despite the film being based on a true story, the characters feel underdeveloped and one-dimensional. There is a noticeable absence of emotional depth, which makes it difficult for the audience to connect with or care about the characters on a deeper level. This lack of character growth and exploration is a missed opportunity that could have elevated the film from being merely good to something truly impactful.Richard Linklater's direction, while competent, fails to fully capitalize on the story's potential. The narrative feels rushed at times, and the pacing issues detract from the overall impact of the film. There are moments that hint at deeper emotional and psychological layers, but these are never fully explored, leaving the audience with a sense of incompleteness.In conclusion, \"Hitman\" is a film that is good for passing the time but doesn't leave a lasting impression. Glen Powell's strong performance and the film's occasional humor make it worth a watch, but the lack of character development and emotional depth prevent it from being anything more than a mildly entertaining diversion. With a more nuanced approach to storytelling and character development, \"Hitman\" could have been much more impactful.",

'Hit Man' somehow achieves the opposite - it's a fluffy confection inspired by the real-life exploits of a psychology professor who masquerades a professional hit man while moonlighting for the police department. Gary Johnson carries out this pretense in order to entrap those looking to hire an assassin.The film's introductory sequences show restaurant encounters where he convinces several would-be murderers he's a hardened criminal in the liquidation business. These meetings are recorded, and the conspirators arrested after clearly stating their intent and handing over a down-payment. Linklater's narrative departs from reality when a beautiful Latina asks him to terminate her abusive husband. To the confusion of his handlers, Gary refuses her payment, and suggests she initiate divorce proceedings instead of contracting a homicide. Needless to say, complications ensue when he secretly starts an affair with her while maintaining his killer-for-hire persona.'Hit Man' could have followed in the footsteps of modern classics like 'Body Heat', but Linklater chooses to play it for light comedy rather than drama. Tension is lost as the proceedings become increasingly frivolous and unlikely. The acting performances and amusing screenplay just about hold one's interest, but the end-result feels like an insubstantial appetizer that could have been a memorable main course with a different approach.",

        "description": "The hitman is already for a long time a popular character in crime and (neo) noir films. For me the ultimate hitman-film is \"The day of the jackal\" (1973, Fred Zinnemann). In this film Edward Fox plays a hitman that is professional, emotionless and a typical loner.Only the last description does apply to Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) in \"The hit man\". He is however not a real hit man but an undercover hit man. He meets people looking for a hit man and makes sure the compromising evidence is on tape.In order to do this he changes outfit all the time and this leads to a comic costume parade, including an imitation of Anton Chigur (Javier Bardem), the hit man from \"No country for old men\" (2007, Ethan & Joel Coen).Being partly a comedy, \"Hit man\" is an odd one in the oeuvre of director Richard Linklater, who is mostly known for his \"Before .... \" relation trilogy (1995, 2004,2013) and his coming of age film \"Boyhood\" (2014).\"Hit man\" really takes of when Gary Johnson falls in love with one of his clients (Maddy Masters played by Adria Arjona). It is the starting point of a roller coaster of numerous unexpected twists and turns.One of the themes is losing sight of the difference between your undercover \"me\" and your real \"me\". It happens in numerous film, but it also happens in reality. In an investigation from 1994 - 1996 the Dutch parliament studied how it happened by the police while combatting organized crime.The fact is however that Gary Johnson has two real \"me's\", one as a part-time police officer and one as a professor in philosophy. The last one delivers the philosophical theme of the movie of how to find a satisfactory balance between ratio and discipline (represented by the Greek God Apollo) and feeling, emotions, instincts and living dangerously (represented by the Greek God Dionysus).Remarkable is that where his most famous films (The \"Before\" trilogy and \"Boyhood\") are typical for an Apollonian world, \"Hit man\" descends to the depths of Dionysus.By the way, \"Hitman\" is in my opinion not very flattering for women, showing how they prefer the sex appeal of a hit man to that of a \"dull\" police officer (let alone a nerdy professor).",

The more of these cases he does, the better he gets; the more fun he has dressing up and adept he becomes at assuming a range of identities.

I find various movies these days don't offer this type of respect to real people or events and the idea of adding fantasy elements and blending them with reality results in some people believing it entirely. This results in a different view towards certain real people and events, which is all just very manipulative and upsetting.

The film is injecting a lot of comedic tones in a dark crime thriller black comedy. It is a balancing act between Glen Powell smirking at the material and him having fun with the material. Sometimes, his light touch does take away the tension. This movie should be spiraling in intensity as he gets trapped by his secret relationship. The two tones of comedy and paranoid crime thriller do not always easily mix. Despite that, this is some light fun with the crime thriller.",

        "description": "Hit Man was such an interesting and welcomed departure from the projects usually led by director, Richard Linklater. It's the kind of story that, much like Edgar Wright's Baby Driver or Shaun of the Dead, would've made for a mediocre movie if directed by an amateur, but made for a great movie because it was directed by an experienced industry professional. All Linklater films are good films.This film keeps you guessing from beginning to end and tells its story in a way that makes the audience feel like they are learning and growing along with the characters. A great example of this is when the film periodically cuts back to Glen Powell's character, Gary Johnson, lecturing students on the everyday behaviors of people. Gary casually and subtly uses his experience as an undercover investigator as the building blocks for these lessons. By doing this, Gary is also introducing and breaking down the overarching themes of the film. It truly is brilliant storytelling.There will never be enough words to properly commend the actors in this film. They brought so much life and enthusiasm to their characters in constant battle between show stealers. In this battle, there were no winners or losers. The acting was balanced and cast members complimented their costars exquisitely.Linklater and Powell's writing was entertaining, truly comedic, well paced, and extremely thoughtful. It is definitely a must see for film buffs searching for depth and those just looking for a fun surface-level comedy. It does both properly in all respects.",

        "description": "Hit Man is a new action comedy directed, written and produced in part by Richard Linklater, director of Boyhood and Before Midnight.Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) is a school teacher, but also secretly works for the police. At one point he has to play a fake hitman with the police. He is hired by clients to commit murders, but after clients confess their criminal plans to Gary, the police can arrest them.When Madison Masters (Adria Arjona) wants to hire Gary, he falls for her beauty. This causes him to break his own rules and try to change Madison's mind so that she does not carry out criminal plans. The two fall in love, but Madison actually falls for the hitman Ron, who played Gary for her. On the other hand, Gary shouldn't show that he's broken his own code to Madison because it could get him in trouble with the police and ruin his career.This film is based on a true story, where the real Gary Johnson posed himself to the police as a hitman who criminals could hire to commit murders. Only after sharing their murderous plans with Gary could the police catch them. The real Gary Johnson had to dress up so many times, wearing different styles of clothes and wigs to appear different to each criminal, so he couldn't be exposed as an undercover cop. Glen Powell also does the same at the beginning of the film. He wears different costumes and also acts in different ways. For example, the film starts off more like an action comedy, but when Gary falls for Madison, the film turns more into a romantic comedy.Richard Linklater provides a comic action film, but with repeated events, where Gary, in different disguises, makes various criminals confess. When the film later turns more into a romantic comedy, this mainly works because of the good chemistry between Glen Powell and Adria Arjona, their characters. Glen Powell only plays a character who leads a double life and his character ends up in a relationship with the possible criminal. This creates complicated situations in which he has to continue working strategically, without Madison or the police realizing that he is actually lying to both of them. However, the film does have a somewhat abrupt ending, which does not seem to answer everything.Glen Powell plays the lead role well and actually has to play the role in different ways. This gives him the opportunity to show different acting capabilities in this film. Adria Arjona also plays the role of a seductive, possible criminal well, because as a viewer, like the main characters, you do not always know whether she can be completely trusted. After his time in various Walking Dead series, Austin Amelio also gets the chance to act in a film. He plays a colleague of the main character, who may thwart his strategic plans if he is told too much.",

Her character although not changing physically like Glen Powell, does demonstrate a multi-dimensional persona. The relationship that develops between these two characters is both romantic and thrilling. The rest of the cast is also good without a single flawed performance.There are some interesting psychological ideas explored in this movie. Not only were the ideas interesting but so was the manner in which they were delivered. Glen Powell's character Gary essentially would speak to his students about certain psychological ideas while simultaneously exploring these ideas as a hitman.Overall, this was a well written and interesting story. It's a good blend of comedy, romance and crime.",

They are completely dazzling together, and the ridiculous situation they find themselves in is beautifully choreographed by Richard Linklater, who directs them into and out of moments that'll have you amused and confounded simultaneously.This is one of the better \"new\" movies I have seen in a long time, and I have absolutely no problem highly recommending this. I wish Hollywood made more films like this, and I'll be perusing Linklater's catalogue to see what other hidden gems might be in lurking in there.

Glen Powell gives a pretty good performance of acting dorky and kinda introverted, yet it feels like most of that is because his glasses are doing most of the acting for him. He's able to play a fun variety of hit men, but that isn't really the central focus. Adria Arjona is pretty good at the love interest with what could best be described as innocently dark intentions.The jokes from many of the side characters didn't really work for me, most notably Gary's two police associates, played by Retta and Sanjay Rao. There seemed to be some kind of underlying message about how we're all capable of change in one way or another, but I feel like that was included to justify the surprisingly dark yet underwhelming ending this movie pulls.Overall, there's not much to say about Hit Man, aside from being an occasionally darkly humorous and empty movie that you'd put on when you don't want to think too hard.",

And the ending kinda took out all the good things (however much measly amount they were) away for sure. Because these things surely will give hope to someone that u can get away from a wrong doing and live happily ever after.As for acting, Glen really has the unreadable face with one or two expressions which worked in his favor in this movie. But Adria. You know those actresses in B or C grade movies where their acts immediately tell u they are fishy and acting and with no subtlety trying to pry information outta u and batting eyelashes to make u do something, her acting in this movie belongs in that category. Anytime she was on screen, i had to endure a fake performance.There was barely any action, any comedy and romantic romance, so defining which genre this one belongs to is hard.

Plus it is based loosely on a true story, which I usually find elevates my interest.That said, it isn't going to blow you away, doesn't do anything new and isn't particularly memorable. I can't fault the performances, and it is a fun enjoyable watch, which is worth viewing at home. I did get a bit of an insight into a whole 'world' of detective work that is legal and I was shocked by how scarily common it is for a spouse, or disgruntled friend/relation/colleague/rival to attempt to set up a hitman to kill.Having since read a bit about the guy upon whom this film's main character is based, his 'success' is undeniable. The parallel lives he led is impressive and fascinating. The statistics we are given on screen are accurate. But, it does become rather a farfetched plot and in some cases of 'based on true events' films I've really felt 'truth can be stranger/more wild than fiction '.However, in the case of Hitman, the twists and turns the story takes are fictional, and discovering this was slightly disappointing but I guess it also makes me feel they did a good job at using a true character and expanding/fleshing out an entertaining yarn!I'd love to see a documentary on this guy, and/or a different director/filmmakers create a more serious, exploration of him or other people who work undercover, and the impact this has upon their psyche, relationships, and the type of person who can actually live a life like this.",

This is what you'd come up with your friend, nothing over the top but still entertaining enough.While there's nothing GREAT about it, the writing and the chemistry between Glen and Adria sell the film well.

        "description": "\"The eternal mystery of human consciousness and behavior.\" Gary Johnson (Glen Powell)Having just enjoyed a summer stroll through an arts festival, I settled for another breezy summer evening with Glen Powell as a nerdy and hot professor and hitman, thanks to the Netflix trick of playing its crime soft and its romance, well, plainly romantic.Promising some truth in the telling, Hitman is based on a feature in Texas Monthly about Gary Johnson, a college philosophy teacher (see the above quote about his interest) who also moonlights with the local police as an ersatz hitman, nailing scores of bad apples looking to hire an assassin usually for reasons of love gone badly. Gary, wearing multiple disguises for his wildly different clients, can further enhance his lectures on the self: \"What if your self is a construct?\" he asks his students.Gary remains an operative who never kills anyone until he meets comely client, Maddy (Adria Arjona), and is drawn into a caper as Ron and lover, possibly becoming at least an accomplice to murder. Meanwhile, director Richard Linklater, who knows a thing or two about actors as lovers, weaves the romance with college lectures on identity and psychological self-styling, common threads in our social-media landscape. Our ability to create our own persona on Facebook or Snapchat, for example, is not unlike his profession, but not quite as dangerous, mostly.You don't need to know Nietzsche to believe that a mild-mannered professor could play a hit man (a student exclaims, \"When did our teacher get hot?\") or that anyone could construct a personality with the help of the Internet. The film becomes more than an amusing thriller as identities play a key role in furthering a promising romance or solving a crime that has murder as a centerpiece.Although more than once it's claimed there are no hitmen now or in history, Hit Man goes a long way in convincing us that they could be real. In more than one extended dialogue, Gary/Ron explains the complexity and allure of switching identities.Hit Man has its own double identity-cool summer caper and dangerous romance, both threatened by electronic surveillance and the human capability of shifting its persona throughout life. Although the subject of identity crafting involving the id, the ego, and the superego can't be adequately discussed in a brief TV melodrama, Hit Man does give one pause. And a brisk summer breeze.",

Truly a fun ride to take.The acting is good on all fronts with special nod to Glen for having fun with multiple characters. Not much negative to discuss. Hit Man does drag a bit in the middle after starting strong but finishes even stronger. That is the key to rewatchability I think, a strong finish.

She had already done so with Gary, which caused him to freak out and give up his fake identity as 'Ron' the hitman. Quite honestly, I can't imagine how the guy was able to make with a comeback for every prospective client who was looking to have someone eliminated. The guy never said the wrong thing and had an answer for every eventuality. Talk about thinking on one's feet!So even though this picture might have been based on a true story, the whole thing had an air of incredulity about it. Getting back to the real Gary Johnson, he assisted in the arrests of more than 70 people seeking contract killers using aliases when it suited his purpose. The Madison Masters character was based on a woman that Johnson referred to social services and a therapist to get the help she needed to end an abusive relationship. When all was said and done, Gary Johnson never did kill anyone as a supposed contract killer, nor did Glen Powell's character, who probably would have missed if he had to pull the trigger.",

        "description": "Certainly! Here's a shorter version of the review:Glen Powell delivers a commendable performance in the film, showcasing his talent and versatility. However, the chemistry between him and the female lead is lacking, and their sensual scenes feel forced and unnatural. The female lead's exaggerated attempts to be alluring through her facial expressions were particularly distracting.Despite these issues, the movie is fun and entertaining. Glen Powell's fans will especially enjoy his charm and energy. The film's upbeat nature makes it a good choice for a casual movie night. However, the disparity in acting abilities among the cast is noticeable and somewhat diminishes the film's potential. If all the actors had matched Powell's level of performance, the movie could have been much better.In conclusion, while I'm not a huge fan of Glen Powell, I can appreciate his strong performance in this film. I hope future projects feature a more balanced ensemble cast to complement his talents. Thanks for reading my review, and I hope you all enjoy the movie despite its flaws!",

        "description": "Believe the hype: Richard Linklater and Glen Powell's Hit Man is awesome! It's a slick, sexy screwball comedy about identity that only a filmmaker like Richard Linklater could properly pull off! I'd say this might even be the must see romantic dark comedy of the decade! Hit Man is definitely a film-lover's paradise but even the casual film viewer will thoroughly enjoy this brilliant new movie. Linklater's latest lovingly pays homage to film noir, screwball comedy, Hitchcockian black comedy and even the good old psychosexual drama but it still somehow manages to conjure up a fresh, witty, and often uproarious confection that frequently teases, delights, and occasionally thrills the audience with frissons of excitement, keeping them enraptured all the way to its deliciously razor sharp ending. Go in blind - it's such a fun movie to experience with a crowd, knowing nothing of what's to come! I absolutely loved my experience watching this movie - it's a shame most people will experience it on Netflix for the first time. But because this movie is so unique and fun to experience knowing nothing about it - I'm gonna keep this short in order to preserve the experience of watching it for the first time! This film has been hyped up for months and yet it was still able to surpass everything I expected of it. This was some fresh, fun, effortless storytelling that works so well, and truly allows Glen Powell to ascend to a new level of movie stardom with such a charismatic performance! This is potentially a star-making turn for Glen Powell. Although he made a strong impression in Top Gun: Maverick as a cocky rival pilot, his role in Hit Man is easily more complex and, as the co-writer of the script, he has been able to add brilliant layers to his character, or should that be characters? His chemistry with the equally terrific Adria Arjona was dynamite, they both had true movie star energy! Both actors bring out the best in one another and it is thrilling! Hit Man is one of the most entertaining films of the year - a slick, cool, and hilarious crime film that deconstructs our notion of what a hitman is while simultaneously examining its lead character's ID, EGO, and SUPEREGO. This is Linklater at his most fun and effortless. A masterclass on direction, writing, and acting, Hit Man is a wild, entertaining ride that I can't wait to see many more times! I LOVED Hit Man, it left me with the biggest smile! It's a - hit, man!",

Glen Powell showed such diversity and intelligence in this role. He played a menagerie of people as an undercover hitman for the police department. He would pretend to be a hitman to expose people who had intent to have someone they know murdered. This was so well done.The scope of this plays from a psychological perspective and left me feeling light and fuzzy as our protagonist's relationship developed with our herione. This was such a playful bend on the stereotypical hitman movies that was so fun and different. Would definitely watch this again.",

        "description": "This movie has been so heavily talked up by some notable film critics no less that I was excited to give it a watch.The premise is simple enough. A philosophy professor moonlighting with a side gig assisting the NOLA Police Department who suddenly falls into the role of a lifetime when he fills in as a hit man for hire insn ongoing sting operation to thwart murder for hire plots. Much to everybody's surprise (himself included), it turns out he's really good at it.Along the way, he falls for a woman who initially comes to him to order a hit on her husband. Their chemistry unavoidable, he talks her out of it, they fall in love and then , in a sudden dark turn, she kills her husband. Yeah, she kills her husband.Rather than a moment of profound tonal shift into Coen Brotheresque neo-noir territory, the story continues apace along the same breezy pace before this shoulda been shocking event. There's no great reckoning. None. This would be weird for any character but for a philosophy professor with a deep regard for the moral clarity and ethics he espouses to his students in class all semester, it's particularly odd. Instead he lets it slide, comes clean with his love interest that he's really not a true hit man and in the process of participating in a murder to cover up the first murder effectively becomes the real thing.In more capable hands this could have been a classic slapdash 60s Cary Grant rom-com even with the unusual twist but it falls way short of anything especially comical or memorable. Like some of Linklater's other movies, there's a tonally flat quality that renders what should have been a really surprising transition little more than half baked and unnecessary. Whatever investment you've made in the characters feel like a waste.",

The tech guy that with a small group at a police department, help nab people that pay a fake hit man to kill someone. One day the guy is not there and so gary is thrust into the role . But he ends up falling for a client called maddy and thats where everything in his life changes. The comedic elements worked along with the more serious parts.

Look for it to receive some awards including a best writing nod.The scene where Gary/Ron is feeding Maddy information via his smart phone while trying to make sure she doesn't confess, is screwball classic.This film is a treasure and deserves to be enjoyed.",

Powell plays Gary, a college professor of psychology and philosophy who moonlights, helping the police with electronic surveillance systems. When the main undercover cop is suspended, they ask Gary to step in. Now as Ron, he excels as a fake Hit Man and is asked by the police to get involved in many other set ups to catch out people looking to hire him to kill people. To do this he adopts disguises and identities to convincingly catch the targets out. One day though, looking to set up a young woman eager to kill her brutal husband, he falls for her and convinces her to back away. A romance begins which gets more and more complicated as he continues to play at being Ron.Fun stuff, which starts off as a straight comedy as he traps all sorts of eccentrics who want to kill husbands and wives etc. However, when the romance starts each scene ramps up the complications with the story becoming increasing dark and seemingly impossible for Gary to escape prison, get the girl etc. Powell is really good - truly now looking like a big star presence - looking at identity and whether it is possible to embrace a new one if required, in turn requiring him to play lots of different characters in order to catch the baddies. A good laugh, clever and worth seeing.",

        "description": "If you enjoy quirky movies, director Richard Linklater is your guy. His latest is HIT MAN, which is a romantic comedy that's very loosely based on an article about a real guy, Gary Johnson. Gary (Glen Powell) is a college professor and part-time staffer at the New Orleans Police Department. He stumbles into a new role as an undercover hitman, arresting people who try hiring him to kill someone. It turns out he's very good at it. Powell really showcases his talents here, playing different characters for each arrest. When he meets Madison (Adria Arjona) though, he breaks protocol. I guess Powell has great chemistry with whoever he works with. He has an undeniable charm that seems like it spreads to the whole cast. I could tell they had fun filming this. It also has a very smart script, playing with ideas of identity and being your true self. The strong sense of humour actually changes as the movie progresses, which was fun for me, but might not work for some. I find it hilarious that they must've asked the real Gary Johnson for permission to go as far as they do here. The movie makes it clear what actually happened during the end credits. HIT MAN is quirky, unconventional, and very enjoyable. If you can't see it in theaters, don't worry! It'll be on Netflix June 7th. Make sure the algorithm doesn't bury it. Enjoy!",

Here, things don't improve, although this time his female costar is just as extravangantly luscious as Sydney Sweeney, only brunette. His character, Gary Johnson dresses up in wigs and hats and costumes and assumes accents and personas to convince qould-be criminals that's he's a real hit man, but only they believe him - the audience certainly doesn't. One critic, Jason Fraley, describes the rom-com arc of the plot as \"Fifty Shades Of Gary\". The film is emotionless and gutless and packs zero punches.

        "description": "Hitman is definitely a film-lover's paradise but even the casual film viewer will thoroughly enjoy this brilliant new movie. Linklater's latest lovingly pays homage to film noir, screwball comedy, Hitchcockian black comedy and even the good old psychosexual drama but it still somehow manages to conjure up a fresh, witty and often uproarious confection that frequently teases, delights and occasionally thrills the audience with frissons of excitement, keeping them enraptured all the way to its deliciously razor sharp ending.This is potentially a star-making turn for Glen Powell. Although he made a strong impression in Top Gun: Maverick as a cocky rival pilot, his role in Hit Man is easily more complex and, as the co-writer of the script, he has been able to add brilliant layers to his character, or should that be characters? In effect, Powell is playing more than one character - Gary Johnson, mild-mannered, cat-loving geeky Psychology professor and audio techie who moonlights as a surveillance expert for a Louisana-based police unit that targets and stings hapless ne'er-do-wells who are looking to hire a killer. Before the next sting operation, Gary's police colleague Jasper (Austin Amelio) who normally pretends to be the hired killer is suspended for brutally attacking two youths, which forces Gary's colleagues (brilliantly played by Retta and Sanjay Rao) into convincing Gary to take over from the universally loathed Jasper, much to Gary's dismay. Yet, within minutes of taking on the task, Gary suddenly morphs into \"Ron\" and during his first sting he is so convincing that his colleagues are shocked, even though they had believed he could do it having heard Jasper go through the rigamarole on previous occasions. It is a brilliant piece of acting.Having created the killer persona, Gary soon finds himself becoming more and more immersed in Ron, adding further, chameleon-like layers of disguise and character traits to mirror whoever is about to be stung. However, things become really complicated (in true film noir style) when \"Ron\" is approached by a femme fatale, Maddy (beautifully played by Adria Ajrona who also adds a delightfully a kooky sexy edge as well as a tender vulnerability). As the sparks between the two begin to fly during a hilarious but flirty exchange, Gary, who is clearly enjoying himself as Ron, finds himself conflicted. Dare he. As Ron, continue with the sting and have Maddy arrested for plotting to murder her husband? Has the flirtatious exchange caused Maddy to betray some regrets about what she is doing? The chemistry between Powell and Arjona is a pleasure to witness. Both actors bring out the best in one another and it is thrilling.Off-beat is an expression that would certainly apply to Hit Man - and it is a compliment. It is also one of the most enjoyable and fun 2 hours I've had in the cinema in the past few years. I absolutely adore this film.",

I liked the writing until the middle when it started to dragg a bit but Powell was fun to watch switching, believeably, between stud and nerd.But WTF with that ending!!Are people just so devoid of humanity that everything has to be accepted as humor? Gary was a great character until Powell and Linkletter decided he was a sociopath.He stays with a woman who cavalierly announce she killed her husband. That doesn't scare Gary away ..no he's in love and has cats So to even out Gary commits his own murder. And right then next to a dying man that they had just drugged and murder they have sex!That people find this funny is beyond me. Not sure I am comfortable with people who do.

The high octane romance tag transpires feels entirely too surface for how emotionally involved it becomes in the end. There were no flashes of actual connection beyond sexual intensity and discussion about murder. It would've been nice to see them have at least one \"get to know you\" interaction outside of the sex-murder dichotomy.The ending is also.... Unnecessary. Maybe for laughs amongst the people who knew the real Gary Johnson, but for storytelling purposes it was a little too campy.An entertaining watch, one of Netflix's better recent films.

There is no doubt that Hit Man is a fun, maybe even entertaining, film at times. Seeing the magnificent Glenn Powell navigate the different personas he create for himself with considerable ease and suaveness is a great joy. But while this undercover average Joe turned hit-man idea may serve as an interesting premise, the film does not develop much from this premise meaningfully. The plot is overly slight, and the direction it goes is bizarre, especially the ending, which felt rushed and contrived. The plot does not develop in a manner which extracts full potential of comedy from its situation, and neither is it particularly entertaining. Also, Despite what some critics have praised, I could not see much chemistry between Arjona and Powell. Sure, they are both more than serviceable in their roles, and they share several steamy scenes, but there is no special spark or unique connection between the two. At the end of the day, I find Hit Man very similar to The Fall Guy, a movie released at around the same time. Both are serviceable, fun, and entertaining distractions which can barely hold and audiences attention for two hours. But both are overly light on actual plot, are only mildly entertaining, and not as funny or enjoyable as they should have been.",

        "description": "My first experience with Glenn Powell was his supporting role in Top Gun: Maverick. He's been around much longer but he was good at playing the brash and cocky Hangman. He's been noteworthy in previous efforts (Hidden Figures was also mentioned by one of my friends) but I was blown away by his work in Hit Man, not only is he fantastic as the suave and smooth Ron but he's also convincing as the reserved and stale Gary (I do have some thoughts on how they present Gary, more on that later). But watching him in Hit Man, it felt like I was watching someone doing acting gymnastics, he's playing so many different and bizarre characters and he nailed every single one. He also has great chemistry with his co-star Adria Arjona, I was just as interested in the their torrid romance than I was in what costume Gary was going to shuffle into next. Speaking of Adria, her work in this was also noteworthy, it would have been easy to make assumptions about Madison's character if Adria's performance didn't make her so mysterious and alluring. She's beautiful, she got her fair share of laughs from me and I was surprised at how invested I was in Gary and Madison's relationship by the end of the movie. I also wanted to credit Austin Amelio, Retta and Sanjay Rao for their collective work in their supporting parts. Another expectation the movie subverts is painting Jasper as a two dimensional villain, Austin makes Jasper unlikeable but not inhuman or not believable as Gary's dejected co-worker.Besides the performances, my favourite part of Hit Man was how it subverts the formula. I can't call it wholly and completely original but I was constantly trying to guess the next twist or shift in the narrative based on similar films. Hit Man continued to zag when I expected it to zig and it's so well layered. Director Richard Linklater and his team have a sense of when they need to switch things up, just when the movie gets too goofy, we get more time with Ron & Madison bonding or when you're about to guess when a twist will happen, the movie will suddenly get much darker. There's several tones at play but they are mixed together so precisely that it kept me entertained when I feel like another movie would have lost me.So many movies are \"based\" on a true story and sure enough, Hit Man isn't the unvarnished truth up on the screen. But the movie is cognizant of the fatigue that comes with this claim and admits it upfront. It helps that the true story is so fantastical that I wasn't bothered in how they tweaked it. Despite the changes, Hit Man is so good natured and seems to being celebrating Gary's unbelievable skill set that I didn't get bogged down in what was true and what wasn't.Hit Man slowly builds toward the finale and despite climax being morally murkier and darker tinged than I maybe expected, I loved how the ending punctuated what was a hugely enjoyable film. I was rooting for Gary/Ron and Madison despite what was revealed about them and it's captured wonderfully by Linklater. The movie doesn't pause to scold you for being sympathetic to one party or another and I liked that it wasn't too concerned with the absolute morality of the characters. The film ends with a metaphorical wink to the audience and it felt like a chef's kiss on a delicious meal.I'm going to be brief about any griping, My only problem is that they don't do a wholly convincing job of dressing Glen Powell down to be the nerdy and shy Gary Johnson when he's just being himself. It's reminiscent of sitcoms slapping glasses on models to trying to present them as dowdy. When everyone is making jokes about how \"normal\" and \"unassuming\" Gary looks, I rolled my eyes a little. But I guess Glen Powell being too handsome to be terribly convincing as a geek college professor is a nice problem to have.Hit Man was such a pleasant surprise, I felt like I was taking a gamble taking friends to see it in the theatre with me but we all walked out impressed. It made me a little sad that it was simultaneously released on Netflix, this is a theatre quality movie and while I understand it might have had a tougher road to profitability than your typical summer tentpole, it earned my ticket price. The film is so much fun, Glen Powell and Adria Arjona light up the screen and the fact that it's based on a true story is just delightful (I loved the end credits joke on how they changed the story). I tip my hat to Powell, Linklater & his team and the real Gary Johnson, I had a great time with Hit Man. I'd rate this at an 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9/10 and while you should check it out on Netflix, you won't regret going to see it in theatres either.",

        "description": "Richard Linklater's (Before Sunrise trilogy, Boyhood) latest film is getting very good reviews so it's quite a surprise once you see it that it's average at best. One of the reasons for that is the lack of variety and emotion Glen Powell puts in (or doesn't) in his performance. There should be a duality between his build-up cocky Ron hit man persona and Gary, his softer, nerdier, normal day-to-day self. Yet, when he supposedly switches between one and the other there's no real substantial difference between the two besides a cosmetic one. One would think this would be the role to show his acting prowess but there seems to be very little and this is nowhere near Bryan Cranston's duality performance skills as Walter White in Breaking Bad if we were to compare an actors task of switching between two sides of a character.There's never any palpable tension in Gary/Ron, he's always in control. He's in control when he becomes the face of the supposed hit-man for the first time (no nervousness, nothing), he is in control when everything starts to unravel, he's in control when he's being confronted with his actions during the climax of the film, and so on - and the film suffers very much from it as we never go along with the main character or actually worry about him, as the main actor never really does anything with it.Likewise, it's a bit boring at times, the cinematography is beyond plain and it's very predictable. The film would have been so much better had it been more stylised, with a more substantial visual flair and a cool soundtrack at least to cover its flaws, since overall there's not really much meat to the story and the film ends up being about nothing.",

We as a viewer saw no romantic or loving conversations in which they got to know each other better and I suppose that's part of the story with Gary being a supposed hitman and all, but it just makes the eventual romance seem sudden and odd.She then decides to drug a cop(!) in her own house(!!), Gary's just okay with it, finishes the job and it just fades into another sex scene and then fast forwards to where they have a happy family.

Based on a true story, the film features commendable performances, particularly from Glen Powell, but suffers from a lack of character development and emotional depth.Glen Powell delivers a standout performance, embodying his character with a mix of charm and authenticity that makes him a compelling figure to watch. His nuanced portrayal brings a layer of believability to the narrative, making the moments of action and subtle humor particularly enjoyable. Powell's ability to infuse his role with both intensity and a touch of levity is one of the film's highlights.The movie does offer a few humorous moments that provide a welcome break from the otherwise serious tone. These lighter scenes are well-executed and add a layer of entertainment, making the film a decent choice for those looking for a casual watch. However, the humor alone is not enough to compensate for the film's more significant shortcomings.One of the primary issues with \"Hitman\" is its lack of character development. Despite the film being based on a true story, the characters feel underdeveloped and one-dimensional. There is a noticeable absence of emotional depth, which makes it difficult for the audience to connect with or care about the characters on a deeper level. This lack of character growth and exploration is a missed opportunity that could have elevated the film from being merely good to something truly impactful.Richard Linklater's direction, while competent, fails to fully capitalize on the story's potential. The narrative feels rushed at times, and the pacing issues detract from the overall impact of the film. There are moments that hint at deeper emotional and psychological layers, but these are never fully explored, leaving the audience with a sense of incompleteness.In conclusion, \"Hitman\" is a film that is good for passing the time but doesn't leave a lasting impression. Glen Powell's strong performance and the film's occasional humor make it worth a watch, but the lack of character development and emotional depth prevent it from being anything more than a mildly entertaining diversion. With a more nuanced approach to storytelling and character development, \"Hitman\" could have been much more impactful.",

'Hit Man' somehow achieves the opposite - it's a fluffy confection inspired by the real-life exploits of a psychology professor who masquerades a professional hit man while moonlighting for the police department. Gary Johnson carries out this pretense in order to entrap those looking to hire an assassin.The film's introductory sequences show restaurant encounters where he convinces several would-be murderers he's a hardened criminal in the liquidation business. These meetings are recorded, and the conspirators arrested after clearly stating their intent and handing over a down-payment. Linklater's narrative departs from reality when a beautiful Latina asks him to terminate her abusive husband. To the confusion of his handlers, Gary refuses her payment, and suggests she initiate divorce proceedings instead of contracting a homicide. Needless to say, complications ensue when he secretly starts an affair with her while maintaining his killer-for-hire persona.'Hit Man' could have followed in the footsteps of modern classics like 'Body Heat', but Linklater chooses to play it for light comedy rather than drama. Tension is lost as the proceedings become increasingly frivolous and unlikely. The acting performances and amusing screenplay just about hold one's interest, but the end-result feels like an insubstantial appetizer that could have been a memorable main course with a different approach.",

Then, Adria Arjona wants her husband dead, but won't come out and say it. Powell tells her to take the money she was going to give him and leave. Later, they meet up and start an affair, but she thinks it's with a hit man. Then her husband dies in an alley.Richard Linklater's movie is not just a good black comedy. It's also a statement about the current belief that you can change who you are by changing what you do. Intellectually it's a bit of a straw man argument in this movie, but it's a story, not a balanced lecture. If it was good enough for George Bernard Shaw, it's good enough for Linklater.",

        "description": "The hitman is already for a long time a popular character in crime and (neo) noir films. For me the ultimate hitman-film is \"The day of the jackal\" (1973, Fred Zinnemann). In this film Edward Fox plays a hitman that is professional, emotionless and a typical loner.Only the last description does apply to Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) in \"The hit man\". He is however not a real hit man but an undercover hit man. He meets people looking for a hit man and makes sure the compromising evidence is on tape.In order to do this he changes outfit all the time and this leads to a comic costume parade, including an imitation of Anton Chigur (Javier Bardem), the hit man from \"No country for old men\" (2007, Ethan & Joel Coen).Being partly a comedy, \"Hit man\" is an odd one in the oeuvre of director Richard Linklater, who is mostly known for his \"Before .... \" relation trilogy (1995, 2004,2013) and his coming of age film \"Boyhood\" (2014).\"Hit man\" really takes of when Gary Johnson falls in love with one of his clients (Maddy Masters played by Adria Arjona). It is the starting point of a roller coaster of numerous unexpected twists and turns.One of the themes is losing sight of the difference between your undercover \"me\" and your real \"me\". It happens in numerous film, but it also happens in reality. In an investigation from 1994 - 1996 the Dutch parliament studied how it happened by the police while combatting organized crime.The fact is however that Gary Johnson has two real \"me's\", one as a part-time police officer and one as a professor in philosophy. The last one delivers the philosophical theme of the movie of how to find a satisfactory balance between ratio and discipline (represented by the Greek God Apollo) and feeling, emotions, instincts and living dangerously (represented by the Greek God Dionysus).Remarkable is that where his most famous films (The \"Before\" trilogy and \"Boyhood\") are typical for an Apollonian world, \"Hit man\" descends to the depths of Dionysus.By the way, \"Hitman\" is in my opinion not very flattering for women, showing how they prefer the sex appeal of a hit man to that of a \"dull\" police officer (let alone a nerdy professor).",

Here, he's a rather geeky teacher (Gary) who teaches philosophy at a college whilst occasionally helping out the cops with some criminal profiling. When one of their investigators \"Jasper\" (Austin Amelio) goes a bit too far and gets suspended, Gary gets drafted in last minute and proves quite effective at getting folks who want to bump of their nearest and dearest for $5,000 to admit their cunning plans to a well wired-up con. The more of these cases he does, the better he gets; the more fun he has dressing up and adept he becomes at assuming a range of identities. It's \"Maddy\" (Adria Arjona) who sets the cat amongst the pigeons when she asks him to get shot of her thuggish husband \"Ray\" (Evan Holtzman). He takes a shine to her and talks her out of her criminal ploy. Quickly the two are seeing each other - which is manna from heaven for the deposed \"Jasper\". When her husband is found dead, he thinks he knows exactly who did what and how best to exact his revenge... It's quite an entertaining romantic thriller this, providing Powell with an opportunity to charm his way through an almost two hours of cinema that is light and fluffy, completely preposterous yet based on a true character. Arjona looks like she is having a good time here, too - and the last twenty minutes are quite fun. No, it won't trouble a BAFTA jury I suspect - but it's quite enjoyable summertime fayre.",

However at some point he starts to moonlight for the police first as tech support, then due to some circumstances as a fake hit man. That second act of the movie is good and entertaining in showing how he does what he does. Then enter Maddy Masters with a serious domestic issue at her hands, The sparks between them are there, they start a romance. Everything ok, until here still a mildly entertaining movie.The problem however is the third act. It's difficult to describe the issue without spoilers so here they come:\nMaddy's husband is dead. It turns out she has killed him. As the investigation shows, a recent life insurance policy could be motive. Gary is sent in to get a confession from Maddy. Instead that he is actively guiding her by providing her with clues how to appear innocent in the exchange.A bit problematic, but hey, this is not a documentary, it's fiction.But of course one of the cops figured out, that it was Maddy who killed her husband and now tries to blackmail her for some of the insurance money. Her solution to the problem: spiking his bottled beer (how?) so he gets unconscious while blackmailing Maddy and Gary. Gary's solution, as drugging a cop does not have the best looks: Killing the cop, obviously.And then, they live happily ever after.So we summarize: Maddy kills her husband probably for the insurance money, Gary covers it up by murdering a cop. Followed by a happy end. Shall this really be the moral of the story? I have my difficulties with that.",

While I don't exactly find it really good and just find at a good rom-com flick, Hit Man offers a more respectable approach that is a nice change of pace of various \"Based on a true story\" movies. Instead of trying to make it seem like all the events in the movie happened in real life in a deceiving manner, Hit Man, based on a real person, openly states the inaccuracies in the movie that are much different from real life events. I find various movies these days don't offer this type of respect to real people or events and the idea of adding fantasy elements and blending them with reality results in some people believing it entirely. This results in a different view towards certain real people and events, which is all just very manipulative and upsetting. While this isn't really that big of an issue (except when it's done a problematic way, such as disrespecting loss of life, tragedy, etc.) but I really do appreciate Hit Man's honesty about it. I absolutely recommend Hit Man as a fun watch and I do love how respectful it is to the real people it's based around.",

The film raises some interesting existential questions, literally. And it's attempts to elevate the material from standard 'rom-com' should be commended, but unfortunately the execution of that ends up being it's undoing.The Bad: This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. First, the pacing. The first hour or so is slow and monotonous. With scenes being repeated as if the film is trying to prove a point, but doesn't actually add anything to the overall character / narrative. Secondly, the film tries too hard to fit in a bunch of different genres and tropes. Is it a rom-com? Sometimes. Is it a dark comedy? I guess. Is it a movie which asks existential questions whilst exploring that theme with the characters? It tries to. Unfortunately it all just mixes into a big pile of bleh. When it could have been so much more if it cut some of the bloat and redundant scenes. Disappointing.Summary: It's not bad and the last half is actually pretty decent. But if you're looking for a classic rom-com with some caper style shenanigns (curse you trailer) - you're not going to find it here. If you're not looking for that, go for it.",

Not only does he talk her out of murder, he starts secretly dating her as the fake hit man.Filmmaker Richard Linklater and Glen Powell got together to make this movie. The film is injecting a lot of comedic tones in a dark crime thriller black comedy. It is a balancing act between Glen Powell smirking at the material and him having fun with the material. Sometimes, his light touch does take away the tension. This movie should be spiraling in intensity as he gets trapped by his secret relationship. The two tones of comedy and paranoid crime thriller do not always easily mix. Despite that, this is some light fun with the crime thriller.",

It's the kind of story that, much like Edgar Wright's Baby Driver or Shaun of the Dead, would've made for a mediocre movie if directed by an amateur, but made for a great movie because it was directed by an experienced industry professional. All Linklater films are good films.This film keeps you guessing from beginning to end and tells its story in a way that makes the audience feel like they are learning and growing along with the characters. A great example of this is when the film periodically cuts back to Glen Powell's character, Gary Johnson, lecturing students on the everyday behaviors of people. Gary casually and subtly uses his experience as an undercover investigator as the building blocks for these lessons. By doing this, Gary is also introducing and breaking down the overarching themes of the film. It truly is brilliant storytelling.There will never be enough words to properly commend the actors in this film. They brought so much life and enthusiasm to their characters in constant battle between show stealers. In this battle, there were no winners or losers. The acting was balanced and cast members complimented their costars exquisitely.Linklater and Powell's writing was entertaining, truly comedic, well paced, and extremely thoughtful. It is definitely a must see for film buffs searching for depth and those just looking for a fun surface-level comedy. It does both properly in all respects.",

        "description": "Hit Man is a new action comedy directed, written and produced in part by Richard Linklater, director of Boyhood and Before Midnight.Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) is a school teacher, but also secretly works for the police. At one point he has to play a fake hitman with the police. He is hired by clients to commit murders, but after clients confess their criminal plans to Gary, the police can arrest them.When Madison Masters (Adria Arjona) wants to hire Gary, he falls for her beauty. This causes him to break his own rules and try to change Madison's mind so that she does not carry out criminal plans. The two fall in love, but Madison actually falls for the hitman Ron, who played Gary for her. On the other hand, Gary shouldn't show that he's broken his own code to Madison because it could get him in trouble with the police and ruin his career.This film is based on a true story, where the real Gary Johnson posed himself to the police as a hitman who criminals could hire to commit murders. Only after sharing their murderous plans with Gary could the police catch them. The real Gary Johnson had to dress up so many times, wearing different styles of clothes and wigs to appear different to each criminal, so he couldn't be exposed as an undercover cop. Glen Powell also does the same at the beginning of the film. He wears different costumes and also acts in different ways. For example, the film starts off more like an action comedy, but when Gary falls for Madison, the film turns more into a romantic comedy.Richard Linklater provides a comic action film, but with repeated events, where Gary, in different disguises, makes various criminals confess. When the film later turns more into a romantic comedy, this mainly works because of the good chemistry between Glen Powell and Adria Arjona, their characters. Glen Powell only plays a character who leads a double life and his character ends up in a relationship with the possible criminal. This creates complicated situations in which he has to continue working strategically, without Madison or the police realizing that he is actually lying to both of them. However, the film does have a somewhat abrupt ending, which does not seem to answer everything.Glen Powell plays the lead role well and actually has to play the role in different ways. This gives him the opportunity to show different acting capabilities in this film. Adria Arjona also plays the role of a seductive, possible criminal well, because as a viewer, like the main characters, you do not always know whether she can be completely trusted. After his time in various Walking Dead series, Austin Amelio also gets the chance to act in a film. He plays a colleague of the main character, who may thwart his strategic plans if he is told too much.",

Not only were the ideas interesting but so was the manner in which they were delivered.

Glen Powell gives a pretty good performance of acting dorky and kinda introverted, yet it feels like most of that is because his glasses are doing most of the acting for him. He's able to play a fun variety of hit men, but that isn't really the central focus. Adria Arjona is pretty good at the love interest with what could best be described as innocently dark intentions.The jokes from many of the side characters didn't really work for me, most notably Gary's two police associates, played by Retta and Sanjay Rao. There seemed to be some kind of underlying message about how we're all capable of change in one way or another, but I feel like that was included to justify the surprisingly dark yet underwhelming ending this movie pulls.Overall, there's not much to say about Hit Man, aside from being an occasionally darkly humorous and empty movie that you'd put on when you don't want to think too hard.",

I can't fault the performances, and it is a fun enjoyable watch, which is worth viewing at home. I did get a bit of an insight into a whole 'world' of detective work that is legal and I was shocked by how scarily common it is for a spouse, or disgruntled friend/relation/colleague/rival to attempt to set up a hitman to kill.Having since read a bit about the guy upon whom this film's main character is based, his 'success' is undeniable. The parallel lives he led is impressive and fascinating. The statistics we are given on screen are accurate. But, it does become rather a farfetched plot and in some cases of 'based on true events' films I've really felt 'truth can be stranger/more wild than fiction '.However, in the case of Hitman, the twists and turns the story takes are fictional, and discovering this was slightly disappointing but I guess it also makes me feel they did a good job at using a true character and expanding/fleshing out an entertaining yarn!I'd love to see a documentary on this guy, and/or a different director/filmmakers create a more serious, exploration of him or other people who work undercover, and the impact this has upon their psyche, relationships, and the type of person who can actually live a life like this.",

Gary, wearing multiple disguises for his wildly different clients, can further enhance his lectures on the self: \"What if your self is a construct?\" he asks his students.Gary remains an operative who never kills anyone until he meets comely client, Maddy (Adria Arjona), and is drawn into a caper as Ron and lover, possibly becoming at least an accomplice to murder. Meanwhile, director Richard Linklater, who knows a thing or two about actors as lovers, weaves the romance with college lectures on identity and psychological self-styling, common threads in our social-media landscape. Our ability to create our own persona on Facebook or Snapchat, for example, is not unlike his profession, but not quite as dangerous, mostly.You don't need to know Nietzsche to believe that a mild-mannered professor could play a hit man (a student exclaims, \"When did our teacher get hot?\") or that anyone could construct a personality with the help of the Internet. The film becomes more than an amusing thriller as identities play a key role in furthering a promising romance or solving a crime that has murder as a centerpiece.Although more than once it's claimed there are no hitmen now or in history, Hit Man goes a long way in convincing us that they could be real. In more than one extended dialogue, Gary/Ron explains the complexity and allure of switching identities.Hit Man has its own double identity-cool summer caper and dangerous romance, both threatened by electronic surveillance and the human capability of shifting its persona throughout life. Although the subject of identity crafting involving the id, the ego, and the superego can't be adequately discussed in a brief TV melodrama, Hit Man does give one pause. And a brisk summer breeze.",

It's like Fletch meets Confessions of a Dangerous Mind with a bit of The Nice Guys and, of course, Linklater's trademark philosophical schtick added. Make no mistake, this isn't trying to be Chinatown - it's most certainly a comedy, in line with the aforementioned movies. There's a lot to like here!Glen Powell is a funny and charming guy who's rising quickly - he's got that Ryan Reynolds, Gosling thing. A touch of Sam Rockwell, too. This is a great role for him!Aaand now the negative - it wrapped up too neatly. I, unfortunately, didn't entirely buy the love story. While intriguing (there was some chemistry!), it was too cut and dry. I'm surprised Linklater went in this direction, frankly, and not sure what to say about it. I guess he had his fun with this zany story and gave us a happy ending, but it felt disingenuous. Didn't ruin it for me, just surprised by the Hollywood ending 🤷‍♂️Overall, I can't deny that it's a step in the right direction for what people want to see. This is entertainment. It delivered. It's funny, sexy and mysterious with good looking people! It's ok to want that - it's what Hollywood was built on. It's been a while since I've enjoyed a newer movie like this, so I'm pretty happy with my 2 hr experience. Flaws and all, it's just fun!",

How was this good guy going to get out of the mess he'd inadvertently created? I wanted to see.But it seems the writers found the situation too difficult to get out of themselves, so in the last few minutes, they cut away from that moral arc and opt instead for an absolutely perverse Hollywood ending: the \"good\" guys choose to transform themselves into \"evil\" guys and then live as \"pretend-to-be-good\" guys in a happily-ever-after Hallmark moment. What?!! Are we supposed to feel good that they got away with murdering two people, neither of them in self-defense, because they are now empowered and sexy? Some excuses were made about how some people \"deserve to be killed\"; apparently this means anyone who is in your way or that you find annoying! This comes from a character who teaches philosophy, his philosophy finally being: be whomever you want to be, just don't be boring. (Being evil is okay, because that's \"hot\"!)I can't say this message is unique in Hollywood these days, the only difference being that this movie is a wolf in sheep's clothing, posing as a rom-com that is actually a tragic farce.Don't bring your children to watch this, unless your goal is to raise sexy little murderers.",

As it is, he passed away in 2022 before \"Hit Man\" started filming, but it's known that the love interest part of the film was entirely fictional, so at least he didn't die a murderer.This was an entertaining flick up to a point, but it got truly weird when Gary (Glen Powell) arrived at Madison Masters' apartment and coached her through a string of lies while his police department associates listening in tried to catch her admitting that she killed her husband. She had already done so with Gary, which caused him to freak out and give up his fake identity as 'Ron' the hitman. Quite honestly, I can't imagine how the guy was able to make with a comeback for every prospective client who was looking to have someone eliminated. The guy never said the wrong thing and had an answer for every eventuality. Talk about thinking on one's feet!So even though this picture might have been based on a true story, the whole thing had an air of incredulity about it. Getting back to the real Gary Johnson, he assisted in the arrests of more than 70 people seeking contract killers using aliases when it suited his purpose. The Madison Masters character was based on a woman that Johnson referred to social services and a therapist to get the help she needed to end an abusive relationship. When all was said and done, Gary Johnson never did kill anyone as a supposed contract killer, nor did Glen Powell's character, who probably would have missed if he had to pull the trigger.",

It is of a fake contract hitman who is assigned as a spoof character by the cops to lure victims of paying contracts out to clients.Except the people paying out become the victims. So one day he falls for a dark-haired woman called Madison Figueroa Masters; played by Adria Arjona and he tells her not to pull on the hit and take the money and run.This is when it all changes his life and her life. It's quite an obvious script from her as the actor acting as the hitman becomes more like the styled hitman he pretends to be; because he has fallen for this girl and is seducing her.She is in lust with his protective character and natural charm; chilvary and etiquitte. Something which her arsehole husband clearly lacks.There are a few twists and turns which you can probably figure out along the way. It's an unrealistic story and it's not a convincing police operation. It is acted very well and the cinema is descent enough but it just is a rushed film and why is it two hours long? It really doesn't need to be. Anyther disappointing straight-to-netflix release.The lead protagonist; Glen Powell does a very good job of blending Ryan Gosling with Garry Oldman. Glen is a superb actor. A shame that the script was just too silly and romanticised. 6/10. Production is excellent. Acting strong.",

However, the chemistry between him and the female lead is lacking, and their sensual scenes feel forced and unnatural. The female lead's exaggerated attempts to be alluring through her facial expressions were particularly distracting.Despite these issues, the movie is fun and entertaining. Glen Powell's fans will especially enjoy his charm and energy. The film's upbeat nature makes it a good choice for a casual movie night. However, the disparity in acting abilities among the cast is noticeable and somewhat diminishes the film's potential. If all the actors had matched Powell's level of performance, the movie could have been much better.In conclusion, while I'm not a huge fan of Glen Powell, I can appreciate his strong performance in this film. I hope future projects feature a more balanced ensemble cast to complement his talents. Thanks for reading my review, and I hope you all enjoy the movie despite its flaws!",

        "description": "Believe the hype: Richard Linklater and Glen Powell's Hit Man is awesome! It's a slick, sexy screwball comedy about identity that only a filmmaker like Richard Linklater could properly pull off! I'd say this might even be the must see romantic dark comedy of the decade! Hit Man is definitely a film-lover's paradise but even the casual film viewer will thoroughly enjoy this brilliant new movie. Linklater's latest lovingly pays homage to film noir, screwball comedy, Hitchcockian black comedy and even the good old psychosexual drama but it still somehow manages to conjure up a fresh, witty, and often uproarious confection that frequently teases, delights, and occasionally thrills the audience with frissons of excitement, keeping them enraptured all the way to its deliciously razor sharp ending. Go in blind - it's such a fun movie to experience with a crowd, knowing nothing of what's to come! I absolutely loved my experience watching this movie - it's a shame most people will experience it on Netflix for the first time. But because this movie is so unique and fun to experience knowing nothing about it - I'm gonna keep this short in order to preserve the experience of watching it for the first time! This film has been hyped up for months and yet it was still able to surpass everything I expected of it. This was some fresh, fun, effortless storytelling that works so well, and truly allows Glen Powell to ascend to a new level of movie stardom with such a charismatic performance! This is potentially a star-making turn for Glen Powell. Although he made a strong impression in Top Gun: Maverick as a cocky rival pilot, his role in Hit Man is easily more complex and, as the co-writer of the script, he has been able to add brilliant layers to his character, or should that be characters? His chemistry with the equally terrific Adria Arjona was dynamite, they both had true movie star energy! Both actors bring out the best in one another and it is thrilling! Hit Man is one of the most entertaining films of the year - a slick, cool, and hilarious crime film that deconstructs our notion of what a hitman is while simultaneously examining its lead character's ID, EGO, and SUPEREGO. This is Linklater at his most fun and effortless. A masterclass on direction, writing, and acting, Hit Man is a wild, entertaining ride that I can't wait to see many more times! I LOVED Hit Man, it left me with the biggest smile! It's a - hit, man!",

A philosophy professor moonlighting with a side gig assisting the NOLA Police Department who suddenly falls into the role of a lifetime when he fills in as a hit man for hire insn ongoing sting operation to thwart murder for hire plots. Much to everybody's surprise (himself included), it turns out he's really good at it.Along the way, he falls for a woman who initially comes to him to order a hit on her husband. Their chemistry unavoidable, he talks her out of it, they fall in love and then , in a sudden dark turn, she kills her husband. Yeah, she kills her husband.Rather than a moment of profound tonal shift into Coen Brotheresque neo-noir territory, the story continues apace along the same breezy pace before this shoulda been shocking event. There's no great reckoning. None. This would be weird for any character but for a philosophy professor with a deep regard for the moral clarity and ethics he espouses to his students in class all semester, it's particularly odd. Instead he lets it slide, comes clean with his love interest that he's really not a true hit man and in the process of participating in a murder to cover up the first murder effectively becomes the real thing.In more capable hands this could have been a classic slapdash 60s Cary Grant rom-com even with the unusual twist but it falls way short of anything especially comical or memorable. Like some of Linklater's other movies, there's a tonally flat quality that renders what should have been a really surprising transition little more than half baked and unnecessary. Whatever investment you've made in the characters feel like a waste.",

One day though, looking to set up a young woman eager to kill her brutal husband, he falls for her and convinces her to back away. A romance begins which gets more and more complicated as he continues to play at being Ron.Fun stuff, which starts off as a straight comedy as he traps all sorts of eccentrics who want to kill husbands and wives etc. However, when the romance starts each scene ramps up the complications with the story becoming increasing dark and seemingly impossible for Gary to escape prison, get the girl etc. Powell is really good - truly now looking like a big star presence - looking at identity and whether it is possible to embrace a new one if required, in turn requiring him to play lots of different characters in order to catch the baddies.

They are:1) The audience should like your protagonists\n2) Have a good ending\"Hit Man\" breaks both rules. It pains me to say that, because 75% of the film I mostly enjoyed. I thought the leads acted well, good chemistry, etc.The film wasn't that funny, if it was trying to be a black comedy, which I \"think\" it was? But as a romantic film it was okay enough. Unfortunately the ending just wasn't well conceived.I thought the final act, as the cops closed in on Madison being a killer, was well set up. But the film decided to give Gary, the male lead, not only a different personality at the end of it all, but a completely different moral compass as well.I looked forward to the final scene between the protagonists, Gary and Madison, and their showdown with a dirty cop.Up to this point, Gary was portrayed as a likable enough guy who seemed to want to do the right thing, even if he occasionally bent the rules it was for the right reasons. Until, well until......Gary mysteriously transforms at the end of the film into a cold blooded cop killer. Who kills his colleague, in a completely blatant act. Just 180 degree turn in character. Was the sex \"that\" good?But besides being an out of character move, the twist makes the protagonists into negative characters, right at the end, so this becomes the lasting impression of them.Weirdly, I think the director frames the actions as strangely just, because Madison's husband \"might've been a jerk\", but this was never shown on screen. The murdered cop was also talked about as being a bad guy but he was never depicted as a bad guy on screen.So because we have to take the word of the characters that these people deserved to die, and that makes it okay? Weird, weird ending.",

Glen acted great acting as multiple different individuals throughout his Hitman performances.",

        "description": "While the conceit of the dark rom-com sparked interest and the reviews were very positive, the actual experience of watching Hit Man began to drag about half-way through its nearly 2 hour runtime. My attention drifted and I began to browse reviews of the movie on my phone, trying to work out how I had been sold such a pup. The two leads are compelling attractive, but the quick-fire scenes used to build their on-screen romance felt tired and clichéd after the enjoyable run of scenes that preceded it, where we see Gary developing his hitman personas to suit his varied client base (with no shortage of intertextual references to other films with memorable killers).The movie picks up in the second half, culminating in one remorseless scene that brings together its themes and philosophy. It was enough to make up for the otherwise uncomfortable sense that the film was a slightly overlong apology for state-sanctioned murder and personal vigilante justice, disguised as a romantic comedy.I was left with the feeling that Hit Man could have been a much tighter, more engaging film if it was only about 25 minutes shorter.",

        "description": "Based on a monthly magazine article which itself was about a very real person, Gary Johnson. A psychology professor by profession, he also assists the New Orleans police department by going undercover. When another police who was tasked with going undercover as a fake hitman is suspended, Gary steps up to become Ron the hitman to catch the potential criminals who approach to hire him. What happens when Gary posing as Ron gets to meet a client and it's love at first sight? What trouble he gets into and how does he come out of the situation, forms rest of the story.Richard Linklater narrates this particular story which shifts gear when it comes to varied genres and it definitely helps to have a charming lead. Gary loves his job and is happy taking care of his pets so when he does get offered to go undercover, he gives his 100% to turn into a fake hit man and an ordinary professor turning into this charmer, is a transition well executed. The humor filled dialogues help ease out even when things seems to get serious. This is a genre that made me want some bigger twist in the final act but Richard chose to be loyal in narrating Gary's story or to say, not that predictable as I expected the story to be. Majority of the fun lies in those lines uttered not just by the lead actors and it's this smart balanced writing where the film wins big time.",

I know Powell is already a leading man but I think he is about to launch into superstardom. This role gave him the chance to show off some range and he was also more handsome and sexier in some of his personas than I have ever seen him before. Not just goody goody boy next store with an awful script (like a different recent Glen Powell movie I had the misfortune of watching) but confident, handsome man with some depth and surprises. And wit! And Arjona was just as talented and gorgeous. While the performances were excellent and thoroughly enjoyable (also from Austin Amelio), the script gave them all something substantive to work with. It's not Shakespeare but it is so much better than the usual crappy, predictable writing with uni-dimensional characters and over-the-top villains. It was witty, it had twists and turns (some of which one can see coming but a few of which surprised me). It was not as dark as I expected and maybe mixing neo-noir with rom-com would annoy some purists. But I just let it be what it is and appreciated seeing something that I have not already seen several times. I often multitask while watching movies but I didn't with this movie. It kept my attention and I didn't want to miss any of it--even facial expressions and, of course, the dynamics between the leads. I was sorry it ended and will definitely watch it again sometime.",

For the majority of the runtime this is an easygoing rom com but it gradually reveals a darker side without losing any of the charm of everything that preceded it. It's a really fun look at the many faces and personalities people can employ depending on the situation and if some people even have a true self.This feels like the final step in Glen Powell's road to becoming a fully fledged movie star. It's the ideal performance to showcase all of his leading man talents thanks to the many performances within the main performance, allowing him to remain thoroughly charming whilst skillfully blurring the lines between Gary and Ron as it goes along.Adria Ajorna is just as essential to this film working and gets an almost equally layered performance that deserves to make her a star as well. Her chemistry with Powell is electric from their very first encounter and she makes her character empathetic whilst adding a sense of mystery to her character as their relationship develops.Richard Linklater is on top form here with understated direction that plays to his strengths. He has a way of making his films feel so warm, trundling along nicely in a way that's patient yet engrossing with characters who are a pleasure to spend 2 hours with. Plus it still feels refreshing to see a mainstream film that isn't afraid to get hot and heavy.",

Amazing directing and producing from all workers that put their time into this film...Richard Linklater, who co-wrote the screenplay with Powell and directed the film, probably did as well as expected with the money and talent he had to work with.

Definitely a novel plot where a quintessential University Professor Gary Johnson ( Glen Powell) who teaches psychology/ philosophy and whose hobby is tinkering with electronics lands up as an undercover agent with the local police department. He has the dubious job of trapping desparados who are ready to pay hitmen like him to eliminate people. He does well, the cops like him but his infatuation for a pretty female client creates problems for him and the police department. Things get messy when a murder takes place, an investigation is ordered and he is a suspect too.Director Richard Linklater had impressed me in \" Boyhood \" but this tale of intrigue and crime is totally a different ball game as far as narratives go. Nevertheless it is a riveting plot and the situations get murkier as the storyline unfolds. Glen Powell is at ease with the changing hues of the character he plays. (Interesting to note that he has collaborated as the writer with Linklater.) The movie could be termed as a dark thriller with the protagonist in a twin personality of the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde type. Adria Arjona as the love interest and Austin Amelio as the colleague have given strong support.",

I think they try to deliver the philosophy part or want to explain why or how characters develop in movies, which people already know. It just makes the story not go smoothly, it has Gary do his job and then come to have sex with Madison 3 times just to let us know that She has the knowledge to set up a murder from the after-sex talk. Rather than develop an antagonist story. So all we got from Jasper is a villain who lost his job because of himself and can't get back because of Gary. And U know what the final scene when Jasper is defeated they just add a sex scene for no reason. But overall it's pretty funny and that is the whole purpose. It would be better if they added music to the movie or had better background music that suits the scene the entire movie is so quite so we could have some memorable things but I guess this is what you're gonna get from a Netflix movie in the theater.",

It's bizarre. Also, she is a murderer. So why would are leading man fall for a bug-eyed psychopath? The film doesn't explain this at all.

But at the end he stood up with a projector and pitched us on joining his pyramid scheme. Thats what this movie feels like - its a hell of a ride but when you get to the end you cant help but feel like all the good was made to soften the blow of the terrible ending. At the end you start to realize it's really an hour and a half or so of great fun that's written to convince you to overlook the moral and emotional objections you're bound to have when the movie's over. But it doesn't work. The objections linger. And as much as I wish I wasn't, I was dissatisfied.Above all else Hit Man is entertaining. Glen Powell shows off a surprising range playing not only Gary, but all of Gary's made-up versions of himself. He's somehow able to covey believable emotion as different characters and still win us over as he navigates the morally ambiguous world of undercover sting operations. I was also very impressed by Adria Arjona who could solicit a hitman and still feel innocent and could be so seductive without it feeling camp. I have a feeling we'll be hearing her name everywhere soon enough. Overall the chemistry was undeniable and these core performances made the movie as enjoyable as it was.But the issue: Gary's problem, according to his ex wife in the beginning of the film, is that he wont change. And to her that's unfortunate because he's passionless and nerdy and stiff. So, throughout the movie as we watch him change into Ron we hear him teach his students about morality and the psychology of the self, which eventually leads him to the conclusion that moral absolutes don't exist and persistent personalities don't either - we can change who we are, we can change right and wrong, its all just contructs anyways. So, in the end he becomes a tough guy and a murderer. And we're supposed to be happy for him.If my girlfriend told me \"you need to change\" and I came back the next day as a psychopath she wouldnt thank me. She'd say \"thats not what I meant.\" Because any conversation about whether we can change is not just about change for change's sake. That was never the question. Gary's problem in the beginning of the film was that he needed personal growth and by the end he still didn't have it. He went from a nerdy guy who was antisocial in a not-talkative way to a cool guy who is antisocial in a clinical way.If they made it tongue in cheek that he'd become a murderer I could see it being passable because its edgy. We could say its satire. But they don't do that. It feels like they really believe that Gary did the right thing in the end. They don't treat him like the subject of a character study. They give him the happily ever after treatment like a hero. He kills his coworker so he can keep going steady with his secret friend with benefits, who also just confessed to murder. And then he says \"yeah that guy was kinda racist and misogynistic\" so we feel less bad about it. And then it cuts to him telling his students \"there are no absolutes.\" The absolute frustration I felt at the end of this movie got me thinking absolutes do exist.All in all I admit I enjoyed most of the movie. My advice is to watch it and then towards the end just pause it and make up an ending for yourself (thats just a social contruct, right? As Gary would say). Then you can have a great time and avoid the feeling someone is secretly trying to convince you to become a villain.P.",

Nothing less, nothing more. A lukewarm experience.It's even, consistent, but never warms up to 30 C degrees or over. I guess that was intentional given the real life implications of the story. It might have been more exciting at times, even frantic in certain scenes, but it wasn't. What a pity.From a movie making point of view, it is almost impeccable. Good direction, simple but effective camerawork, good score and editing, and most of all, superb acting makes it a good and quite joyful watch.If you look for a light entertainment, there you go. You can leave your brains at home. No worries.",

It should provide all sorts of setups for dark comedy and the means to upend both genres. Unfortunately this movie skews too far in the direction of romcom. There's a funny prelude in which Glen Powell showcases his comedic chops under the guise of various personas. After that the the movie becomes an extended one-note joke in which the gag is simply that it's a romcom with horrible people as the protagonists. The idea wears out its welcome long before the movie ends and otherwise not a whole lot happens.",

        "description": "This was billed as a quirky, clever Rom-Com by both its trailers and critics. The trailers looked fantastic, like a spirited passion project between Linklater and Powell that would parody the whole Rom-Com genre in witty fashion. The reality is this is just another Rom-Com film with critics falling head-over-heels with Linklater (as they always do). The most interesting part of the film is actually the first act, when Glen Powell gets to shine in a diverse portfolio of characters, including a long, gritty dialogue exchange. By the time the love interest appears in the second act, the film has already fallen into just another collage of good cop/good person/bad circumstance entanglement. Unfortunately the film never really redeems itself, nor its characters in unforgiveable acts. Its story feels mundane and outcome certain. While I had hoped for more, it was at least an easy viewing.",

His latest is HIT MAN, which is a romantic comedy that's very loosely based on an article about a real guy, Gary Johnson. Gary (Glen Powell) is a college professor and part-time staffer at the New Orleans Police Department. He stumbles into a new role as an undercover hitman, arresting people who try hiring him to kill someone. It turns out he's very good at it. Powell really showcases his talents here, playing different characters for each arrest. When he meets Madison (Adria Arjona) though, he breaks protocol. I guess Powell has great chemistry with whoever he works with. He has an undeniable charm that seems like it spreads to the whole cast. I could tell they had fun filming this. It also has a very smart script, playing with ideas of identity and being your true self. The strong sense of humour actually changes as the movie progresses, which was fun for me, but might not work for some. I find it hilarious that they must've asked the real Gary Johnson for permission to go as far as they do here. The movie makes it clear what actually happened during the end credits. HIT MAN is quirky, unconventional, and very enjoyable. If you can't see it in theaters, don't worry! It'll be on Netflix June 7th. Make sure the algorithm doesn't bury it. Enjoy!",

        "date": "7 October 2023",
        "description": "Hitman is definitely a film-lover's paradise but even the casual film viewer will thoroughly enjoy this brilliant new movie. Linklater's latest lovingly pays homage to film noir, screwball comedy, Hitchcockian black comedy and even the good old psychosexual drama but it still somehow manages to conjure up a fresh, witty and often uproarious confection that frequently teases, delights and occasionally thrills the audience with frissons of excitement, keeping them enraptured all the way to its deliciously razor sharp ending.This is potentially a star-making turn for Glen Powell. Although he made a strong impression in Top Gun: Maverick as a cocky rival pilot, his role in Hit Man is easily more complex and, as the co-writer of the script, he has been able to add brilliant layers to his character, or should that be characters? In effect, Powell is playing more than one character - Gary Johnson, mild-mannered, cat-loving geeky Psychology professor and audio techie who moonlights as a surveillance expert for a Louisana-based police unit that targets and stings hapless ne'er-do-wells who are looking to hire a killer. Before the next sting operation, Gary's police colleague Jasper (Austin Amelio) who normally pretends to be the hired killer is suspended for brutally attacking two youths, which forces Gary's colleagues (brilliantly played by Retta and Sanjay Rao) into convincing Gary to take over from the universally loathed Jasper, much to Gary's dismay. Yet, within minutes of taking on the task, Gary suddenly morphs into \"Ron\" and during his first sting he is so convincing that his colleagues are shocked, even though they had believed he could do it having heard Jasper go through the rigamarole on previous occasions. It is a brilliant piece of acting.Having created the killer persona, Gary soon finds himself becoming more and more immersed in Ron, adding further, chameleon-like layers of disguise and character traits to mirror whoever is about to be stung. However, things become really complicated (in true film noir style) when \"Ron\" is approached by a femme fatale, Maddy (beautifully played by Adria Ajrona who also adds a delightfully a kooky sexy edge as well as a tender vulnerability). As the sparks between the two begin to fly during a hilarious but flirty exchange, Gary, who is clearly enjoying himself as Ron, finds himself conflicted. Dare he. As Ron, continue with the sting and have Maddy arrested for plotting to murder her husband? Has the flirtatious exchange caused Maddy to betray some regrets about what she is doing? The chemistry between Powell and Arjona is a pleasure to witness. Both actors bring out the best in one another and it is thrilling.Off-beat is an expression that would certainly apply to Hit Man - and it is a compliment. It is also one of the most enjoyable and fun 2 hours I've had in the cinema in the past few years. I absolutely adore this film.",

There is no doubt that Hit Man is a fun, maybe even entertaining, film at times. Seeing the magnificent Glenn Powell navigate the different personas he create for himself with considerable ease and suaveness is a great joy. But while this undercover average Joe turned hit-man idea may serve as an interesting premise, the film does not develop much from this premise meaningfully. The plot is overly slight, and the direction it goes is bizarre, especially the ending, which felt rushed and contrived. The plot does not develop in a manner which extracts full potential of comedy from its situation, and neither is it particularly entertaining. Also, Despite what some critics have praised, I could not see much chemistry between Arjona and Powell. Sure, they are both more than serviceable in their roles, and they share several steamy scenes, but there is no special spark or unique connection between the two. At the end of the day, I find Hit Man very similar to The Fall Guy, a movie released at around the same time. Both are serviceable, fun, and entertaining distractions which can barely hold and audiences attention for two hours. But both are overly light on actual plot, are only mildly entertaining, and not as funny or enjoyable as they should have been.",

        "description": "My first experience with Glenn Powell was his supporting role in Top Gun: Maverick. He's been around much longer but he was good at playing the brash and cocky Hangman. He's been noteworthy in previous efforts (Hidden Figures was also mentioned by one of my friends) but I was blown away by his work in Hit Man, not only is he fantastic as the suave and smooth Ron but he's also convincing as the reserved and stale Gary (I do have some thoughts on how they present Gary, more on that later). But watching him in Hit Man, it felt like I was watching someone doing acting gymnastics, he's playing so many different and bizarre characters and he nailed every single one. He also has great chemistry with his co-star Adria Arjona, I was just as interested in the their torrid romance than I was in what costume Gary was going to shuffle into next. Speaking of Adria, her work in this was also noteworthy, it would have been easy to make assumptions about Madison's character if Adria's performance didn't make her so mysterious and alluring. She's beautiful, she got her fair share of laughs from me and I was surprised at how invested I was in Gary and Madison's relationship by the end of the movie. I also wanted to credit Austin Amelio, Retta and Sanjay Rao for their collective work in their supporting parts. Another expectation the movie subverts is painting Jasper as a two dimensional villain, Austin makes Jasper unlikeable but not inhuman or not believable as Gary's dejected co-worker.Besides the performances, my favourite part of Hit Man was how it subverts the formula. I can't call it wholly and completely original but I was constantly trying to guess the next twist or shift in the narrative based on similar films. Hit Man continued to zag when I expected it to zig and it's so well layered. Director Richard Linklater and his team have a sense of when they need to switch things up, just when the movie gets too goofy, we get more time with Ron & Madison bonding or when you're about to guess when a twist will happen, the movie will suddenly get much darker. There's several tones at play but they are mixed together so precisely that it kept me entertained when I feel like another movie would have lost me.So many movies are \"based\" on a true story and sure enough, Hit Man isn't the unvarnished truth up on the screen. But the movie is cognizant of the fatigue that comes with this claim and admits it upfront. It helps that the true story is so fantastical that I wasn't bothered in how they tweaked it. Despite the changes, Hit Man is so good natured and seems to being celebrating Gary's unbelievable skill set that I didn't get bogged down in what was true and what wasn't.Hit Man slowly builds toward the finale and despite climax being morally murkier and darker tinged than I maybe expected, I loved how the ending punctuated what was a hugely enjoyable film. I was rooting for Gary/Ron and Madison despite what was revealed about them and it's captured wonderfully by Linklater. The movie doesn't pause to scold you for being sympathetic to one party or another and I liked that it wasn't too concerned with the absolute morality of the characters. The film ends with a metaphorical wink to the audience and it felt like a chef's kiss on a delicious meal.I'm going to be brief about any griping, My only problem is that they don't do a wholly convincing job of dressing Glen Powell down to be the nerdy and shy Gary Johnson when he's just being himself. It's reminiscent of sitcoms slapping glasses on models to trying to present them as dowdy. When everyone is making jokes about how \"normal\" and \"unassuming\" Gary looks, I rolled my eyes a little. But I guess Glen Powell being too handsome to be terribly convincing as a geek college professor is a nice problem to have.Hit Man was such a pleasant surprise, I felt like I was taking a gamble taking friends to see it in the theatre with me but we all walked out impressed. It made me a little sad that it was simultaneously released on Netflix, this is a theatre quality movie and while I understand it might have had a tougher road to profitability than your typical summer tentpole, it earned my ticket price. The film is so much fun, Glen Powell and Adria Arjona light up the screen and the fact that it's based on a true story is just delightful (I loved the end credits joke on how they changed the story). I tip my hat to Powell, Linklater & his team and the real Gary Johnson, I had a great time with Hit Man. I'd rate this at an 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9/10 and while you should check it out on Netflix, you won't regret going to see it in theatres either.",

One of the reasons for that is the lack of variety and emotion Glen Powell puts in (or doesn't) in his performance. There should be a duality between his build-up cocky Ron hit man persona and Gary, his softer, nerdier, normal day-to-day self. Yet, when he supposedly switches between one and the other there's no real substantial difference between the two besides a cosmetic one. One would think this would be the role to show his acting prowess but there seems to be very little and this is nowhere near Bryan Cranston's duality performance skills as Walter White in Breaking Bad if we were to compare an actors task of switching between two sides of a character.There's never any palpable tension in Gary/Ron, he's always in control. He's in control when he becomes the face of the supposed hit-man for the first time (no nervousness, nothing), he is in control when everything starts to unravel, he's in control when he's being confronted with his actions during the climax of the film, and so on - and the film suffers very much from it as we never go along with the main character or actually worry about him, as the main actor never really does anything with it.Likewise, it's a bit boring at times, the cinematography is beyond plain and it's very predictable. The film would have been so much better had it been more stylised, with a more substantial visual flair and a cool soundtrack at least to cover its flaws, since overall there's not really much meat to the story and the film ends up being about nothing.",

The first entire 2/3 of this is a slog and a jumble of implausible and boring events, the it rises very slightly and briefly when the aforementioned One Good Scene occurs, only to divebomb very hard into a completely incomprehensibly ruinous ending. Bad storytelling, bad direction, bad script, The actors do their jobs well, but with so little to work with. A truly lightweight piece of product from an \"artist\" director. Not a proud moment for him, not in the slightest.",

There are maybe three other male actors right now in this category: George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt. Powell makes this movie work, his easygoing affability papers over the movie's contrivances and wobbly morality, and distracts from Linklater's bland, almost TV-movie like set-ups and blocking. Linklater's best films-Slacker, the Before Trilogy, Boyhood-present a consistent visual style, but most of his work is interchangeable with any number of directors-for-hire.",

We as a viewer saw no romantic or loving conversations in which they got to know each other better and I suppose that's part of the story with Gary being a supposed hitman and all, but it just makes the eventual romance seem sudden and odd.She then decides to drug a cop(!) in her own house(!!), Gary's just okay with it, finishes the job and it just fades into another sex scene and then fast forwards to where they have a happy family. You're telling me they killed a cop on the spot without any planning and alibis and got away with it? I really didn't expect this so called action comedy to end like that.",

        "description": "\"Hitman,\" directed by Richard Linklater, is an intriguing yet uneven journey that offers glimpses of potential but ultimately falls short of being a memorable cinematic experience. Based on a true story, the film features commendable performances, particularly from Glen Powell, but suffers from a lack of character development and emotional depth.Glen Powell delivers a standout performance, embodying his character with a mix of charm and authenticity that makes him a compelling figure to watch. His nuanced portrayal brings a layer of believability to the narrative, making the moments of action and subtle humor particularly enjoyable. Powell's ability to infuse his role with both intensity and a touch of levity is one of the film's highlights.The movie does offer a few humorous moments that provide a welcome break from the otherwise serious tone. These lighter scenes are well-executed and add a layer of entertainment, making the film a decent choice for those looking for a casual watch. However, the humor alone is not enough to compensate for the film's more significant shortcomings.One of the primary issues with \"Hitman\" is its lack of character development. Despite the film being based on a true story, the characters feel underdeveloped and one-dimensional. There is a noticeable absence of emotional depth, which makes it difficult for the audience to connect with or care about the characters on a deeper level. This lack of character growth and exploration is a missed opportunity that could have elevated the film from being merely good to something truly impactful.Richard Linklater's direction, while competent, fails to fully capitalize on the story's potential. The narrative feels rushed at times, and the pacing issues detract from the overall impact of the film. There are moments that hint at deeper emotional and psychological layers, but these are never fully explored, leaving the audience with a sense of incompleteness.In conclusion, \"Hitman\" is a film that is good for passing the time but doesn't leave a lasting impression. Glen Powell's strong performance and the film's occasional humor make it worth a watch, but the lack of character development and emotional depth prevent it from being anything more than a mildly entertaining diversion. With a more nuanced approach to storytelling and character development, \"Hitman\" could have been much more impactful.",

We have a nerdy main character I can definitely relate to as a fellow nerd and a fellow educator.I did not really know who Glen Powell was before this. I had seen some movies he has a role in, but as he has been more of a character actor, I wasn't really aware of him. Here, he can kind of use that. He is supposed to be forgettable and learn to be something else.Powell also co-wrote the movie, his first feature as the writer. The story is nothing special. It's kind of obvious after the premises, but it does work nicely as something to hang all these jokes on.It doesn't really fall into copaganda either, which is a rarity.",

        "description": "Richard Linklater's career has been regularly punctuated by intense and innovative stories created from everyday beginnings. 'Hit Man' somehow achieves the opposite - it's a fluffy confection inspired by the real-life exploits of a psychology professor who masquerades a professional hit man while moonlighting for the police department. Gary Johnson carries out this pretense in order to entrap those looking to hire an assassin.The film's introductory sequences show restaurant encounters where he convinces several would-be murderers he's a hardened criminal in the liquidation business. These meetings are recorded, and the conspirators arrested after clearly stating their intent and handing over a down-payment. Linklater's narrative departs from reality when a beautiful Latina asks him to terminate her abusive husband. To the confusion of his handlers, Gary refuses her payment, and suggests she initiate divorce proceedings instead of contracting a homicide. Needless to say, complications ensue when he secretly starts an affair with her while maintaining his killer-for-hire persona.'Hit Man' could have followed in the footsteps of modern classics like 'Body Heat', but Linklater chooses to play it for light comedy rather than drama. Tension is lost as the proceedings become increasingly frivolous and unlikely. The acting performances and amusing screenplay just about hold one's interest, but the end-result feels like an insubstantial appetizer that could have been a memorable main course with a different approach.",

Then, Adria Arjona wants her husband dead, but won't come out and say it. Powell tells her to take the money she was going to give him and leave. Later, they meet up and start an affair, but she thinks it's with a hit man. Then her husband dies in an alley.Richard Linklater's movie is not just a good black comedy. It's also a statement about the current belief that you can change who you are by changing what you do. Intellectually it's a bit of a straw man argument in this movie, but it's a story, not a balanced lecture. If it was good enough for George Bernard Shaw, it's good enough for Linklater.",

        "description": "The hitman is already for a long time a popular character in crime and (neo) noir films. For me the ultimate hitman-film is \"The day of the jackal\" (1973, Fred Zinnemann). In this film Edward Fox plays a hitman that is professional, emotionless and a typical loner.Only the last description does apply to Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) in \"The hit man\". He is however not a real hit man but an undercover hit man. He meets people looking for a hit man and makes sure the compromising evidence is on tape.In order to do this he changes outfit all the time and this leads to a comic costume parade, including an imitation of Anton Chigur (Javier Bardem), the hit man from \"No country for old men\" (2007, Ethan & Joel Coen).Being partly a comedy, \"Hit man\" is an odd one in the oeuvre of director Richard Linklater, who is mostly known for his \"Before .... \" relation trilogy (1995, 2004,2013) and his coming of age film \"Boyhood\" (2014).\"Hit man\" really takes of when Gary Johnson falls in love with one of his clients (Maddy Masters played by Adria Arjona). It is the starting point of a roller coaster of numerous unexpected twists and turns.One of the themes is losing sight of the difference between your undercover \"me\" and your real \"me\". It happens in numerous film, but it also happens in reality. In an investigation from 1994 - 1996 the Dutch parliament studied how it happened by the police while combatting organized crime.The fact is however that Gary Johnson has two real \"me's\", one as a part-time police officer and one as a professor in philosophy. The last one delivers the philosophical theme of the movie of how to find a satisfactory balance between ratio and discipline (represented by the Greek God Apollo) and feeling, emotions, instincts and living dangerously (represented by the Greek God Dionysus).Remarkable is that where his most famous films (The \"Before\" trilogy and \"Boyhood\") are typical for an Apollonian world, \"Hit man\" descends to the depths of Dionysus.By the way, \"Hitman\" is in my opinion not very flattering for women, showing how they prefer the sex appeal of a hit man to that of a \"dull\" police officer (let alone a nerdy professor).",

Here, he's a rather geeky teacher (Gary) who teaches philosophy at a college whilst occasionally helping out the cops with some criminal profiling. When one of their investigators \"Jasper\" (Austin Amelio) goes a bit too far and gets suspended, Gary gets drafted in last minute and proves quite effective at getting folks who want to bump of their nearest and dearest for $5,000 to admit their cunning plans to a well wired-up con. The more of these cases he does, the better he gets; the more fun he has dressing up and adept he becomes at assuming a range of identities. It's \"Maddy\" (Adria Arjona) who sets the cat amongst the pigeons when she asks him to get shot of her thuggish husband \"Ray\" (Evan Holtzman). He takes a shine to her and talks her out of her criminal ploy. Quickly the two are seeing each other - which is manna from heaven for the deposed \"Jasper\". When her husband is found dead, he thinks he knows exactly who did what and how best to exact his revenge... It's quite an entertaining romantic thriller this, providing Powell with an opportunity to charm his way through an almost two hours of cinema that is light and fluffy, completely preposterous yet based on a true character. Arjona looks like she is having a good time here, too - and the last twenty minutes are quite fun. No, it won't trouble a BAFTA jury I suspect - but it's quite enjoyable summertime fayre.",

Then enter Maddy Masters with a serious domestic issue at her hands, The sparks between them are there, they start a romance. Everything ok, until here still a mildly entertaining movie.The problem however is the third act. It's difficult to describe the issue without spoilers so here they come:\nMaddy's husband is dead. It turns out she has killed him. As the investigation shows, a recent life insurance policy could be motive. Gary is sent in to get a confession from Maddy. Instead that he is actively guiding her by providing her with clues how to appear innocent in the exchange.A bit problematic, but hey, this is not a documentary, it's fiction.But of course one of the cops figured out, that it was Maddy who killed her husband and now tries to blackmail her for some of the insurance money. Her solution to the problem: spiking his bottled beer (how?) so he gets unconscious while blackmailing Maddy and Gary. Gary's solution, as drugging a cop does not have the best looks: Killing the cop, obviously.And then, they live happily ever after.So we summarize: Maddy kills her husband probably for the insurance money, Gary covers it up by murdering a cop. Followed by a happy end. Shall this really be the moral of the story? I have my difficulties with that.",

While I don't exactly find it really good and just find at a good rom-com flick, Hit Man offers a more respectable approach that is a nice change of pace of various \"Based on a true story\" movies. Instead of trying to make it seem like all the events in the movie happened in real life in a deceiving manner, Hit Man, based on a real person, openly states the inaccuracies in the movie that are much different from real life events. I find various movies these days don't offer this type of respect to real people or events and the idea of adding fantasy elements and blending them with reality results in some people believing it entirely. This results in a different view towards certain real people and events, which is all just very manipulative and upsetting. While this isn't really that big of an issue (except when it's done a problematic way, such as disrespecting loss of life, tragedy, etc.) but I really do appreciate Hit Man's honesty about it.

First, the pacing. The first hour or so is slow and monotonous. With scenes being repeated as if the film is trying to prove a point, but doesn't actually add anything to the overall character / narrative. Secondly, the film tries too hard to fit in a bunch of different genres and tropes. Is it a rom-com? Sometimes. Is it a dark comedy? I guess. Is it a movie which asks existential questions whilst exploring that theme with the characters? It tries to. Unfortunately it all just mixes into a big pile of bleh. When it could have been so much more if it cut some of the bloat and redundant scenes. Disappointing.Summary: It's not bad and the last half is actually pretty decent.

It's the kind of story that, much like Edgar Wright's Baby Driver or Shaun of the Dead, would've made for a mediocre movie if directed by an amateur, but made for a great movie because it was directed by an experienced industry professional. All Linklater films are good films.This film keeps you guessing from beginning to end and tells its story in a way that makes the audience feel like they are learning and growing along with the characters. A great example of this is when the film periodically cuts back to Glen Powell's character, Gary Johnson, lecturing students on the everyday behaviors of people. Gary casually and subtly uses his experience as an undercover investigator as the building blocks for these lessons. By doing this, Gary is also introducing and breaking down the overarching themes of the film. It truly is brilliant storytelling.There will never be enough words to properly commend the actors in this film. They brought so much life and enthusiasm to their characters in constant battle between show stealers. In this battle, there were no winners or losers. The acting was balanced and cast members complimented their costars exquisitely.Linklater and Powell's writing was entertaining, truly comedic, well paced, and extremely thoughtful.

At one point he has to play a fake hitman with the police. He is hired by clients to commit murders, but after clients confess their criminal plans to Gary, the police can arrest them.When Madison Masters (Adria Arjona) wants to hire Gary, he falls for her beauty. This causes him to break his own rules and try to change Madison's mind so that she does not carry out criminal plans. The two fall in love, but Madison actually falls for the hitman Ron, who played Gary for her. On the other hand, Gary shouldn't show that he's broken his own code to Madison because it could get him in trouble with the police and ruin his career.This film is based on a true story, where the real Gary Johnson posed himself to the police as a hitman who criminals could hire to commit murders. Only after sharing their murderous plans with Gary could the police catch them. The real Gary Johnson had to dress up so many times, wearing different styles of clothes and wigs to appear different to each criminal, so he couldn't be exposed as an undercover cop. Glen Powell also does the same at the beginning of the film. He wears different costumes and also acts in different ways. For example, the film starts off more like an action comedy, but when Gary falls for Madison, the film turns more into a romantic comedy.Richard Linklater provides a comic action film, but with repeated events, where Gary, in different disguises, makes various criminals confess. When the film later turns more into a romantic comedy, this mainly works because of the good chemistry between Glen Powell and Adria Arjona, their characters. Glen Powell only plays a character who leads a double life and his character ends up in a relationship with the possible criminal. This creates complicated situations in which he has to continue working strategically, without Madison or the police realizing that he is actually lying to both of them. However, the film does have a somewhat abrupt ending, which does not seem to answer everything.Glen Powell plays the lead role well and actually has to play the role in different ways. This gives him the opportunity to show different acting capabilities in this film. Adria Arjona also plays the role of a seductive, possible criminal well, because as a viewer, like the main characters, you do not always know whether she can be completely trusted. After his time in various Walking Dead series, Austin Amelio also gets the chance to act in a film. He plays a colleague of the main character, who may thwart his strategic plans if he is told too much.",

But, it does become rather a farfetched plot and in some cases of 'based on true events' films I've really felt 'truth can be stranger/more wild than fiction '.However, in the case of Hitman, the twists and turns the story takes are fictional, and discovering this was slightly disappointing but I guess it also makes me feel they did a good job at using a true character and expanding/fleshing out an entertaining yarn!I'd love to see a documentary on this guy, and/or a different director/filmmakers create a more serious, exploration of him or other people who work undercover, and the impact this has upon their psyche, relationships, and the type of person who can actually live a life like this.",

        "description": "A mostly fictional take of a true story, Hit Man, was way better than I thought it would be. Glen Powell plays a professor who ends up side-gigging for the NOLA PD; ends up standing in as a fake hit-man and realizes he's GOOD at it. One thing leads to another and things go wrong and that makes the rest of this 'dark-thriller comedy' story.This seems like a couple friends having an idea, coming up with the screenplay, one directs and produces it and the other acts in it. This is what you'd come up with your friend, nothing over the top but still entertaining enough.While there's nothing GREAT about it, the writing and the chemistry between Glen and Adria sell the film well. This + the under 2hr runtime = a light watch on a Friday night / over the weekend. (An almost) Direct release to Netflix as well. If you're in the mood for a 'popcorn flick', look this one up.",

        "description": "\"The eternal mystery of human consciousness and behavior.\" Gary Johnson (Glen Powell)Having just enjoyed a summer stroll through an arts festival, I settled for another breezy summer evening with Glen Powell as a nerdy and hot professor and hitman, thanks to the Netflix trick of playing its crime soft and its romance, well, plainly romantic.Promising some truth in the telling, Hitman is based on a feature in Texas Monthly about Gary Johnson, a college philosophy teacher (see the above quote about his interest) who also moonlights with the local police as an ersatz hitman, nailing scores of bad apples looking to hire an assassin usually for reasons of love gone badly. Gary, wearing multiple disguises for his wildly different clients, can further enhance his lectures on the self: \"What if your self is a construct?\" he asks his students.Gary remains an operative who never kills anyone until he meets comely client, Maddy (Adria Arjona), and is drawn into a caper as Ron and lover, possibly becoming at least an accomplice to murder. Meanwhile, director Richard Linklater, who knows a thing or two about actors as lovers, weaves the romance with college lectures on identity and psychological self-styling, common threads in our social-media landscape. Our ability to create our own persona on Facebook or Snapchat, for example, is not unlike his profession, but not quite as dangerous, mostly.You don't need to know Nietzsche to believe that a mild-mannered professor could play a hit man (a student exclaims, \"When did our teacher get hot?\") or that anyone could construct a personality with the help of the Internet. The film becomes more than an amusing thriller as identities play a key role in furthering a promising romance or solving a crime that has murder as a centerpiece.Although more than once it's claimed there are no hitmen now or in history, Hit Man goes a long way in convincing us that they could be real. In more than one extended dialogue, Gary/Ron explains the complexity and allure of switching identities.Hit Man has its own double identity-cool summer caper and dangerous romance, both threatened by electronic surveillance and the human capability of shifting its persona throughout life. Although the subject of identity crafting involving the id, the ego, and the superego can't be adequately discussed in a brief TV melodrama, Hit Man does give one pause. And a brisk summer breeze.",

First the obvious, is it a good story that people want to hear. Check. Secondly, for screenplays a story should have a certain flow about it since the audience will not be using their imagination to visualize said story. This is where Hit Man really shines. It simultaneously leads the audience effortlessly, from one plot point to the next all while throwing curve balls the whole way so we don't know where to look. Truly a fun ride to take.The acting is good on all fronts with special nod to Glen for having fun with multiple characters. Not much negative to discuss. Hit Man does drag a bit in the middle after starting strong but finishes even stronger. That is the key to rewatchability I think, a strong finish. A couple of characters don't add much but also don't detract so it's fine. Yes, green light, no spoilers. Go in fresh and have fun!",

This is a great role for him!Aaand now the negative - it wrapped up too neatly. I, unfortunately, didn't entirely buy the love story. While intriguing (there was some chemistry!), it was too cut and dry. I'm surprised Linklater went in this direction, frankly, and not sure what to say about it. I guess he had his fun with this zany story and gave us a happy ending, but it felt disingenuous. Didn't ruin it for me, just surprised by the Hollywood ending 🤷‍♂️Overall, I can't deny that it's a step in the right direction for what people want to see. This is entertainment. It delivered.

What?!! Are we supposed to feel good that they got away with murdering two people, neither of them in self-defense, because they are now empowered and sexy? Some excuses were made about how some people \"deserve to be killed\"; apparently this means anyone who is in your way or that you find annoying! This comes from a character who teaches philosophy, his philosophy finally being: be whomever you want to be, just don't be boring. (Being evil is okay, because that's \"hot\"!)I can't say this message is unique in Hollywood these days, the only difference being that this movie is a wolf in sheep's clothing, posing as a rom-com that is actually a tragic farce.Don't bring your children to watch this, unless your goal is to raise sexy little murderers.",

As it is, he passed away in 2022 before \"Hit Man\" started filming, but it's known that the love interest part of the film was entirely fictional, so at least he didn't die a murderer.This was an entertaining flick up to a point, but it got truly weird when Gary (Glen Powell) arrived at Madison Masters' apartment and coached her through a string of lies while his police department associates listening in tried to catch her admitting that she killed her husband. She had already done so with Gary, which caused him to freak out and give up his fake identity as 'Ron' the hitman. Quite honestly, I can't imagine how the guy was able to make with a comeback for every prospective client who was looking to have someone eliminated. The guy never said the wrong thing and had an answer for every eventuality. Talk about thinking on one's feet!So even though this picture might have been based on a true story, the whole thing had an air of incredulity about it. Getting back to the real Gary Johnson, he assisted in the arrests of more than 70 people seeking contract killers using aliases when it suited his purpose. The Madison Masters character was based on a woman that Johnson referred to social services and a therapist to get the help she needed to end an abusive relationship. When all was said and done, Gary Johnson never did kill anyone as a supposed contract killer, nor did Glen Powell's character, who probably would have missed if he had to pull the trigger.",

It is of a fake contract hitman who is assigned as a spoof character by the cops to lure victims of paying contracts out to clients.Except the people paying out become the victims. So one day he falls for a dark-haired woman called Madison Figueroa Masters; played by Adria Arjona and he tells her not to pull on the hit and take the money and run.This is when it all changes his life and her life. It's quite an obvious script from her as the actor acting as the hitman becomes more like the styled hitman he pretends to be; because he has fallen for this girl and is seducing her.She is in lust with his protective character and natural charm; chilvary and etiquitte. Something which her arsehole husband clearly lacks.There are a few twists and turns which you can probably figure out along the way. It's an unrealistic story and it's not a convincing police operation. It is acted very well and the cinema is descent enough but it just is a rushed film and why is it two hours long? It really doesn't need to be. Anyther disappointing straight-to-netflix release.The lead protagonist; Glen Powell does a very good job of blending Ryan Gosling with Garry Oldman.

However, the chemistry between him and the female lead is lacking, and their sensual scenes feel forced and unnatural. The female lead's exaggerated attempts to be alluring through her facial expressions were particularly distracting.Despite these issues, the movie is fun and entertaining. Glen Powell's fans will especially enjoy his charm and energy. The film's upbeat nature makes it a good choice for a casual movie night. However, the disparity in acting abilities among the cast is noticeable and somewhat diminishes the film's potential.

It's a slick, sexy screwball comedy about identity that only a filmmaker like Richard Linklater could properly pull off! I'd say this might even be the must see romantic dark comedy of the decade! Hit Man is definitely a film-lover's paradise but even the casual film viewer will thoroughly enjoy this brilliant new movie. Linklater's latest lovingly pays homage to film noir, screwball comedy, Hitchcockian black comedy and even the good old psychosexual drama but it still somehow manages to conjure up a fresh, witty, and often uproarious confection that frequently teases, delights, and occasionally thrills the audience with frissons of excitement, keeping them enraptured all the way to its deliciously razor sharp ending. Go in blind - it's such a fun movie to experience with a crowd, knowing nothing of what's to come! I absolutely loved my experience watching this movie - it's a shame most people will experience it on Netflix for the first time. But because this movie is so unique and fun to experience knowing nothing about it - I'm gonna keep this short in order to preserve the experience of watching it for the first time! This film has been hyped up for months and yet it was still able to surpass everything I expected of it. This was some fresh, fun, effortless storytelling that works so well, and truly allows Glen Powell to ascend to a new level of movie stardom with such a charismatic performance! This is potentially a star-making turn for Glen Powell. Although he made a strong impression in Top Gun: Maverick as a cocky rival pilot, his role in Hit Man is easily more complex and, as the co-writer of the script, he has been able to add brilliant layers to his character, or should that be characters? His chemistry with the equally terrific Adria Arjona was dynamite, they both had true movie star energy! Both actors bring out the best in one another and it is thrilling! Hit Man is one of the most entertaining films of the year - a slick, cool, and hilarious crime film that deconstructs our notion of what a hitman is while simultaneously examining its lead character's ID, EGO, and SUPEREGO. This is Linklater at his most fun and effortless. A masterclass on direction, writing, and acting, Hit Man is a wild, entertaining ride that I can't wait to see many more times!

A philosophy professor moonlighting with a side gig assisting the NOLA Police Department who suddenly falls into the role of a lifetime when he fills in as a hit man for hire insn ongoing sting operation to thwart murder for hire plots. Much to everybody's surprise (himself included), it turns out he's really good at it.Along the way, he falls for a woman who initially comes to him to order a hit on her husband. Their chemistry unavoidable, he talks her out of it, they fall in love and then , in a sudden dark turn, she kills her husband. Yeah, she kills her husband.Rather than a moment of profound tonal shift into Coen Brotheresque neo-noir territory, the story continues apace along the same breezy pace before this shoulda been shocking event. There's no great reckoning. None. This would be weird for any character but for a philosophy professor with a deep regard for the moral clarity and ethics he espouses to his students in class all semester, it's particularly odd. Instead he lets it slide, comes clean with his love interest that he's really not a true hit man and in the process of participating in a murder to cover up the first murder effectively becomes the real thing.In more capable hands this could have been a classic slapdash 60s Cary Grant rom-com even with the unusual twist but it falls way short of anything especially comical or memorable. Like some of Linklater's other movies, there's a tonally flat quality that renders what should have been a really surprising transition little more than half baked and unnecessary. Whatever investment you've made in the characters feel like a waste.",

Lot of viewers has gone into this movie with the expectation of action or thriller and got disappointed, and it shows in the IMDb reviews.End of the day it's still a Rom-com and you should go view it with such expectations. There is an interesting story has being added to the romance story with some good dialogues and even better looking people in it.Hope this helps.",

        "description": "Most of the dissatisfied reviewers ignore the fact that this is a black comedy. There has to be some discomfort in it.And what most if not all of them overlook is that Gary is taken over (killed in some sense) by Ron, after a tour de force of acting as various hit men. That, and the all out love affair between Ron and Maddy, explains it all.It's fiction, well written and well acted, with a clever plot, a shocking ending and a boffo performance by Glen Powell. Look for it to receive some awards including a best writing nod.The scene where Gary/Ron is feeding Maddy information via his smart phone while trying to make sure she doesn't confess, is screwball classic.This film is a treasure and deserves to be enjoyed.",

        "description": "Dark romantic comedy thriller starring Glen Powell and based in part on a true story. Powell plays Gary, a college professor of psychology and philosophy who moonlights, helping the police with electronic surveillance systems. When the main undercover cop is suspended, they ask Gary to step in. Now as Ron, he excels as a fake Hit Man and is asked by the police to get involved in many other set ups to catch out people looking to hire him to kill people. To do this he adopts disguises and identities to convincingly catch the targets out. One day though, looking to set up a young woman eager to kill her brutal husband, he falls for her and convinces her to back away. A romance begins which gets more and more complicated as he continues to play at being Ron.Fun stuff, which starts off as a straight comedy as he traps all sorts of eccentrics who want to kill husbands and wives etc. However, when the romance starts each scene ramps up the complications with the story becoming increasing dark and seemingly impossible for Gary to escape prison, get the girl etc. Powell is really good - truly now looking like a big star presence - looking at identity and whether it is possible to embrace a new one if required, in turn requiring him to play lots of different characters in order to catch the baddies. A good laugh, clever and worth seeing.",

He solicited offers to murder people, and when the conversations were recorded, the perps were arrested and many of them were convicted of attempted murder. The characters of some of the sleaziest types imaginable.The scenes were lively and creative, and there was a good connection between Ron/Gary and one of his purported victims. A romantic involvement ensues.The show stealer is the actress playing the role of Madison. The film is worth the price of admission for the scene where Madison impersonates a stewardess with Gary playing the role of the Captain.",

It didn't hurt there were cats (I'm a cat person), but seriously the charisma coming off the protagonist (played by Glen Powell) is almost overwhelming. What a charming actor and a wonderful character (especially for someone who spent decades working in higher ed).The story is fun. The characters are fun. The costumes are hysterically fun.And then there is Glen Powell. Wow. I guess I've never noticed him before although I did see the most recent Top Gun. The man has a really excellent comedic spirit. I found myself smiling during his scenes. He's that enjoyable.After it ended (and I know some people don't like the ending but I am not one of them) I felt *happy*.

The storytelling is simple and understated, characteristic of director Richard Linklater's style. As expected from Linklater, the movie is dialogue-heavy, providing rich, thought-provoking content.The film delves into themes of psychology, philosophy, and personal development, exploring these areas extensively and effectively. It's not your typical action-packed, slapstick comedy; instead, it offers a more intellectual and reflective experience.If you're expecting a mainstream action-comedy, take a closer look at the director's name! Linklater, known for films like \"Boyhood,\" \"Everybody Wants Some!!,\" \"Before Sunset,\" \"Before Sunrise,\" \"Before Midnight,\" and \"School of Rock,\" brings his unique touch to \"HIT MAN,\" making it a worthwhile watch for those who appreciate deeper narratives and character studies.",

        "description": "I believe there are 2 cardinal rules to filmmaking, if you stick to these things most people will enjoy your film. They are:1) The audience should like your protagonists\n2) Have a good ending\"Hit Man\" breaks both rules. It pains me to say that, because 75% of the film I mostly enjoyed. I thought the leads acted well, good chemistry, etc.The film wasn't that funny, if it was trying to be a black comedy, which I \"think\" it was? But as a romantic film it was okay enough. Unfortunately the ending just wasn't well conceived.I thought the final act, as the cops closed in on Madison being a killer, was well set up. But the film decided to give Gary, the male lead, not only a different personality at the end of it all, but a completely different moral compass as well.I looked forward to the final scene between the protagonists, Gary and Madison, and their showdown with a dirty cop.Up to this point, Gary was portrayed as a likable enough guy who seemed to want to do the right thing, even if he occasionally bent the rules it was for the right reasons. Until, well until......Gary mysteriously transforms at the end of the film into a cold blooded cop killer. Who kills his colleague, in a completely blatant act. Just 180 degree turn in character. Was the sex \"that\" good?But besides being an out of character move, the twist makes the protagonists into negative characters, right at the end, so this becomes the lasting impression of them.Weirdly, I think the director frames the actions as strangely just, because Madison's husband \"might've been a jerk\", but this was never shown on screen. The murdered cop was also talked about as being a bad guy but he was never depicted as a bad guy on screen.So because we have to take the word of the characters that these people deserved to die, and that makes it okay? Weird, weird ending.",

My attention drifted and I began to browse reviews of the movie on my phone, trying to work out how I had been sold such a pup. The two leads are compelling attractive, but the quick-fire scenes used to build their on-screen romance felt tired and clichéd after the enjoyable run of scenes that preceded it, where we see Gary developing his hitman personas to suit his varied client base (with no shortage of intertextual references to other films with memorable killers).The movie picks up in the second half, culminating in one remorseless scene that brings together its themes and philosophy. It was enough to make up for the otherwise uncomfortable sense that the film was a slightly overlong apology for state-sanctioned murder and personal vigilante justice, disguised as a romantic comedy.I was left with the feeling that Hit Man could have been a much tighter, more engaging film if it was only about 25 minutes shorter.",

A psychology professor by profession, he also assists the New Orleans police department by going undercover. When another police who was tasked with going undercover as a fake hitman is suspended, Gary steps up to become Ron the hitman to catch the potential criminals who approach to hire him. What happens when Gary posing as Ron gets to meet a client and it's love at first sight? What trouble he gets into and how does he come out of the situation, forms rest of the story.Richard Linklater narrates this particular story which shifts gear when it comes to varied genres and it definitely helps to have a charming lead. Gary loves his job and is happy taking care of his pets so when he does get offered to go undercover, he gives his 100% to turn into a fake hit man and an ordinary professor turning into this charmer, is a transition well executed. The humor filled dialogues help ease out even when things seems to get serious. This is a genre that made me want some bigger twist in the final act but Richard chose to be loyal in narrating Gary's story or to say, not that predictable as I expected the story to be. Majority of the fun lies in those lines uttered not just by the lead actors and it's this smart balanced writing where the film wins big time.",

I know Powell is already a leading man but I think he is about to launch into superstardom. This role gave him the chance to show off some range and he was also more handsome and sexier in some of his personas than I have ever seen him before. Not just goody goody boy next store with an awful script (like a different recent Glen Powell movie I had the misfortune of watching) but confident, handsome man with some depth and surprises. And wit! And Arjona was just as talented and gorgeous. While the performances were excellent and thoroughly enjoyable (also from Austin Amelio), the script gave them all something substantive to work with. It's not Shakespeare but it is so much better than the usual crappy, predictable writing with uni-dimensional characters and over-the-top villains. It was witty, it had twists and turns (some of which one can see coming but a few of which surprised me). It was not as dark as I expected and maybe mixing neo-noir with rom-com would annoy some purists. But I just let it be what it is and appreciated seeing something that I have not already seen several times. I often multitask while watching movies but I didn't with this movie. It kept my attention and I didn't want to miss any of it--even facial expressions and, of course, the dynamics between the leads. I was sorry it ended and will definitely watch it again sometime.",

For the majority of the runtime this is an easygoing rom com but it gradually reveals a darker side without losing any of the charm of everything that preceded it. It's a really fun look at the many faces and personalities people can employ depending on the situation and if some people even have a true self.This feels like the final step in Glen Powell's road to becoming a fully fledged movie star. It's the ideal performance to showcase all of his leading man talents thanks to the many performances within the main performance, allowing him to remain thoroughly charming whilst skillfully blurring the lines between Gary and Ron as it goes along.Adria Ajorna is just as essential to this film working and gets an almost equally layered performance that deserves to make her a star as well. Her chemistry with Powell is electric from their very first encounter and she makes her character empathetic whilst adding a sense of mystery to her character as their relationship develops.Richard Linklater is on top form here with understated direction that plays to his strengths. He has a way of making his films feel so warm, trundling along nicely in a way that's patient yet engrossing with characters who are a pleasure to spend 2 hours with.

He has the dubious job of trapping desparados who are ready to pay hitmen like him to eliminate people. He does well, the cops like him but his infatuation for a pretty female client creates problems for him and the police department. Things get messy when a murder takes place, an investigation is ordered and he is a suspect too.Director Richard Linklater had impressed me in \" Boyhood \" but this tale of intrigue and crime is totally a different ball game as far as narratives go. Nevertheless it is a riveting plot and the situations get murkier as the storyline unfolds. Glen Powell is at ease with the changing hues of the character he plays. (Interesting to note that he has collaborated as the writer with Linklater.) The movie could be termed as a dark thriller with the protagonist in a twin personality of the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde type.

I think they try to deliver the philosophy part or want to explain why or how characters develop in movies, which people already know. It just makes the story not go smoothly, it has Gary do his job and then come to have sex with Madison 3 times just to let us know that She has the knowledge to set up a murder from the after-sex talk. Rather than develop an antagonist story. So all we got from Jasper is a villain who lost his job because of himself and can't get back because of Gary. And U know what the final scene when Jasper is defeated they just add a sex scene for no reason. But overall it's pretty funny and that is the whole purpose.

        "description": "Glenn Powel is definitely a rising star, and he was the standout in Linkletter's baseball movie. This starts out strong mostly because of Powell's charm and comedic timing. Two things happen to derail this film. First the plot takes a sharp turn, and the film suddenly becomes a romantic comedy. Second the lead actress in said romance gives one of the worst performance that I have ever seen. It's like we are airlifted out of charming crime thriller and dropped into one of the most awkward second acts I have ever watched. I don't know who this actress is but she is awful. She tries to be cute and silly but her performance just took me right out of the movie. For some reason, she makes the decision to use her bulging eyes as an Italian actor might use their hands. It's bizarre. Also, she is a murderer. So why would are leading man fall for a bug-eyed psychopath? The film doesn't explain this at all. Suddenly they're married with kids, and this ending is not happy. It feels tragic, as both of them have covered up murders. In romantic comedies you either pull for a couple to get together or you don't. In this one, the moment this actress comes on the thinking Gary Johnston should run for the hills.",

        "description": "After thinking for a bit I've finally found a way to describe how this movie felt to me: once I went to a BBQ hosted by a friend that was incredible - great food, great company, great location. But at the end he stood up with a projector and pitched us on joining his pyramid scheme. Thats what this movie feels like - its a hell of a ride but when you get to the end you cant help but feel like all the good was made to soften the blow of the terrible ending. At the end you start to realize it's really an hour and a half or so of great fun that's written to convince you to overlook the moral and emotional objections you're bound to have when the movie's over. But it doesn't work. The objections linger. And as much as I wish I wasn't, I was dissatisfied.Above all else Hit Man is entertaining. Glen Powell shows off a surprising range playing not only Gary, but all of Gary's made-up versions of himself. He's somehow able to covey believable emotion as different characters and still win us over as he navigates the morally ambiguous world of undercover sting operations. I was also very impressed by Adria Arjona who could solicit a hitman and still feel innocent and could be so seductive without it feeling camp. I have a feeling we'll be hearing her name everywhere soon enough. Overall the chemistry was undeniable and these core performances made the movie as enjoyable as it was.But the issue: Gary's problem, according to his ex wife in the beginning of the film, is that he wont change. And to her that's unfortunate because he's passionless and nerdy and stiff. So, throughout the movie as we watch him change into Ron we hear him teach his students about morality and the psychology of the self, which eventually leads him to the conclusion that moral absolutes don't exist and persistent personalities don't either - we can change who we are, we can change right and wrong, its all just contructs anyways. So, in the end he becomes a tough guy and a murderer. And we're supposed to be happy for him.If my girlfriend told me \"you need to change\" and I came back the next day as a psychopath she wouldnt thank me. She'd say \"thats not what I meant.\" Because any conversation about whether we can change is not just about change for change's sake. That was never the question. Gary's problem in the beginning of the film was that he needed personal growth and by the end he still didn't have it. He went from a nerdy guy who was antisocial in a not-talkative way to a cool guy who is antisocial in a clinical way.If they made it tongue in cheek that he'd become a murderer I could see it being passable because its edgy. We could say its satire. But they don't do that. It feels like they really believe that Gary did the right thing in the end. They don't treat him like the subject of a character study. They give him the happily ever after treatment like a hero. He kills his coworker so he can keep going steady with his secret friend with benefits, who also just confessed to murder. And then he says \"yeah that guy was kinda racist and misogynistic\" so we feel less bad about it. And then it cuts to him telling his students \"there are no absolutes.\" The absolute frustration I felt at the end of this movie got me thinking absolutes do exist.All in all I admit I enjoyed most of the movie. My advice is to watch it and then towards the end just pause it and make up an ending for yourself (thats just a social contruct, right? As Gary would say). Then you can have a great time and avoid the feeling someone is secretly trying to convince you to become a villain.P.",

        "description": "On one level Hitman a fun and very entertaining ride with lots of broad comedy that should enjoy wide appeal. On another level it is a dialogue-heavy, deep-ish study on the nature personality. The success of this film is that I think it manages to be both things, quite effortlessly.Glen Powell is extremely watchable with a Tom Cruise-esque star quality with a hint of smugness. Adria Arjona is equally strong brining an unpredictable manic energy.The story is jam packed with numerous twists and turns. If you are only familiar with Richard Linklater from his tremendous 'before' trilogy, then you might be in for a surprise with the sheer amount of plot in Hit Man. It's not a bad thing, but the more detail-oriented viewer my find themselves getting hung up on some of the leaps.Overall, Hit Man didn't click for me as a great film but it was a good film which I thoroughly enjoyed.",

One day, he is selected to work in a series of undercover sting operations, getting wire-tapped confessions from those planning on arranging contract killings. But things take a misfiring turn, when he ends up falling for one of his assignments, in the shape of Madison (Adria Arjona), a young woman at the behest of her abusive ex, only for things to take a massive turn when crooked agent Jasper (Austin Amelio) gets in on their arrangement.There was a film from 1997 called Grosse Pointe Blank, that received some critical acclaim at the time despite a limit in much of the way of a wide release. Writer/director Richard Linklater's film would seem to owe much of its inspiration to this source, and seems to be another well received subversive take on the 'hitman' genre, spinning conventional wisdom of the standard tropes of films featuring these characters on their head at one point, with a colourful montage of past films from this genre, from some of the oldest ones to more modern stuff like 2008's In Bruges.Linklater's film seems a confusing jumble of genres, with elements of action, comedy and thriller thrown into the mix, but somehow keeps you engaged with everything that's going on, an original, engaging film, with its sly, wise-cracking script never letting up, and never letting the pace sag. It helps that the cast are all relatively unknown, and so no one overshadows the script or film in itself. That said, lead stars Powell and Arjona are perfectly up to the job, Powell curiously convincing as a man who can alternate between mild mannered lecturer and guy caught up in the criminal underworld, whilst Arjona is a sultry seductress who serves as a perfect foil to everyone's plans.It's an unsteady combination of different genres, and as a result it sometimes comes off weirdly, most notably with a morally iffy ending that could leave you feeling funny. But somehow, it all works, and you're left with one of the most original and worthwhile efforts in a while. ****",

There were so many plot holes and unbelievable situations that made this a bad movie, despite best efforts from everyone involved. From plot elements and settings from movies like \"Body Heat\", \"American Psycho\" and \"Twin Peaks\", I guess there was foreshadowing that in the end, we would are going to discover that the 2 main characters are just your typical garden variety psychopaths/murderers. The things that happen in the movie are unbelievable. The way Powell's character Gary starts to act once we find out what Madison really is doing is unbelievable. The movie completely falls apart when we find out the truth and the story becomes completely ridiculous at that point. Along with the silly \"The idea of You\", this movie and others being churned out have beautiful stars with great acting talent and sexy love scenes, but the scripts are stupid, poorly written and derivative. Cringed hard for the pilot fantasy scene. Hoping Powell's next movie will have a good script. The Brooke Shield's rom com was horrid as well - one of many terrible movies out there.

Arjona actually has a lot of charm and reminds me of Meghan Markle with a few brief flashes of Monroe.The plot is fine - although it all goes on too long and 40 minutes pass before we even see Arjona. However, after that it picks up and as the plot thickens I actually started to care about how they would get out of the mess they were in.And then we have three inexcusable errors:-1. Arjona apparently is the person who murdered her husband. This is a twist I didn't expect to see and although - sure - it does indeed make things more difficult and sets up an amusing scene where Powell has to silently coach Arjona what to say while they're being listened to by the cops on his wire, are we really supposed to give her a pass for murder? I mean, she's cute, but not that cute!2. In order to cover up the fact that she murdered her husband Powell then proceeds to murder in cold blood the (admittedly annoying) cop who's figured out the truth and is trying to shake them down for the insurance money. Sure, he's not a nice guy, but our leads have committed TWO murders now and we're still supposed to be on their side?3. And then, to top it all off, instead of them both dying in an accident or getting their just desserts (not pie) in some other way... THEY JUST LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER on the insurance payout from murdering her husband!Seriously, whoever thought it was acceptable to make a comedy where both the main characters commit murder and then live happily ever after with no retribution whatsoever is a disturbingly morally deficient individual.And then the movie production company approved this and it gets an 85 review score on Metacrtitic?Am I losing my mind here, or is there something seriously wrong with the society we're living in these days?2/10 because Arjona is cute.",

        "description": "In Richard Linklater's Hit Man, philosophy lecturer Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) ponders the question of how many people truly know themselves. The film tells the story of Johnson working for the New Orleans Police Department as a fake hit man for its sting operations. He is an amiable, Honda Civic-driving, bird-watching Everyman in shorts and glasses, who turns out to be the perfect fake assassin. Despite his unreadable face, Gary gets the gig at a moment's notice because the usual guy got caught beating up teens and got himself a 120-day suspension. However, Gary is a natural and convincingly transforms into a badass as soon as he meets his mark. This is similar to the scene in Collateral where Jamie Foxx's mousy cabbie has to pose as Tom Cruise's stone-cold assassin and suddenly becomes a new man. Glen Powell's performance in Hit Man might make him a movie-star because it is at heart a fantasy. Gary plays a figure out of our collective imagination, playing a figure out of our collective imagination. He researches his clients beforehand and tailors his look for their expectations of a hit man, making up the character as he sees fit. He meets Madison (Adria Arjona), a terrified wife being tormented by an unstable, domineering husband. She tries to hire Gary, but he slyly convinces her to give up on the idea because he doesn't want her going to prison. They fall in love, but she thinks he's still \"Ron,\" the grizzled, open-collared killer who showed her some genuine compassion and impromptu life coaching. Gary also thinks he's Ron, or at least becomes Ron whenever he's with her, so much so that he's now a demon in bed. He has the instincts of a tougher guy when they're together, and when Madison's estranged husband spots them at a club and threatens them, Gary immediately pulls out a gun, Clint Eastwood-style, and backs him off. Hit Man is a film that deconstructs the concept of stardom by presenting a character we cannot be, and then making us believe we can be him. The film's amiable filmmaking and Powell's charming, self-aware swagger are infused with the idea that anything is possible, making the world seem open, malleable, and accepting. The auteur theory has been criticized for its lack of focus on the material, but Linklater's breeziness and generosity as a director work wonders in this film. It serves as a rebuke to other hit-man movies at Venice this year, such as David Fincher's The Killer and Harmony Korine's Aggro Dr1ft. Linklater's film feels genuinely fresh, with fun for the star and the audience. The film's overt philosophical digressions, such as Gary's lectures to his classes, are easygoing and lively. Linklater's gentle touch is his secret weapon, and Hit Man might be a masterpiece. The film's overt philosophical digressions, in the form of Gary's lectures to his classes, are equally easygoing and lively.",

Glen Powell plays an everyman university teacher who, on the side, did electrical / tech work for the police. Until one day, the police, short on staff ask him to go in undercover. The entire story of how he rises to the occasion and turns out to be great in the role of \"hit man\" was pure gold... though a little over the top. And I thought they were going someplace with it. In an early scene the main character's ex-wife suggests to him that if you become someone for long enough, you can change into that person.The problem is the end of the movie. Where (not at all true to life) this mild mannered professor chooses to become an accessory to murder and then murders one of the cops. All so his \"love\" and he can stay together. The movie seems to want us to be happy for them because they get away with it and the movie stands there like -- good for them. Err... no, not good for them.I really wonder what is happening in Hollywood that they think this ending is ok.",

        "description": "After passing through various festivals and having the presence of one of the great contemporary directors, Hit Man was preceded by a great reception and the truth is that it is confirmed once we see what will surely be among the best films of the year when we make the final count.A highly professional director like Richard Linklater is possibly the great secret weapon for making this film work the way it does, taking into account that in other hands it will most likely not have the same satisfaction that one gets. A director who has known how to provide great black comedies, once again achieves the task of satisfying us as viewers with an intelligent, well-thought-out and very well-structured film, which in turn leads you to immediately connect with a story that seems to be going too slowly, but That, just like its protagonist, makes an immediate click and we don't realize how deeply we are immersed in a plot that captivates us as each dialogue passes.Also for everything to work perfectly we need effective protagonists and Glen Powell shows everyone that he is an actor who is efficiently reaping his current moment of recognition, beyond the physical appearance, he is also a very good actor and Here we can see it in all its dimension and in all its aspects that allow it to shine from beginning to end. In that same place we can leave Adria Arjona, who possibly gives one of her strongest performances to date, complementing herself and sharing her level with her co-star without having to reproach an actress who is on the rise. Two incredibly well-written and very well-acted characters with whom it is impossible not to have a connection with them.It is such an intelligent film that hides behind its title all the deception that its characters possess, it is a clever and hilarious comedy that incredibly in its dialogues hides the best weapon to provide you with the most absolute entertainment so far this year. We are left with a sexy and ingenious proposal that is positioned as an entertaining proposal beyond the explosions and chases. A captivating comedy that dares to narratively go beyond the commonplaces that logic might presume. The Linklater style is more than present in the one that also elevates a new Hollywood star like Glen Powell.A satisfactory film in all its aspects that crosses different genres without clashing in any of them and allowing itself to establish itself as one of the most refreshing proposals so far in 2024. It deserves to be seen and enjoyed and to indulge in the fun of an original proposal , conquering, exciting and perfectly achieved.",

Because whenever one of their films comes out and is bad I'm really not that surprised. But when something of theirs comes out and is great I usually think it deserves to be put out somewhere else and the the latter very much sums up how I feel about this movie.Hit Man is totally riveting as a viewing experience and I'm glad I got to see it in a theatre while I could. Because this film is utterly hilarious in a way that feels referential to other films that we've seen before but it still feels like its own vision. Glen Powell is basically perfect in this role and I loved still managing to feel invested in his journey despite becoming more and more conflicted by the actions that he takes. As a crime thriller it's totally effective and as a dark comedy it's utterly hilarious. Despite the fact that I felt the core story could've been stronger I was always interested to see where it went next.I'm already very excited to see it again and as of now it's one of the best original movies that Netflix has put out.",

It follows a divorced, mild-mannered psychology professor, Gary Johnson (Glen Powell), who lives alone with his two cats, Id and Ego. He has also worked part-time with the New Orleans Police Department as a technical advisor on some undercover operations. Suddenly, Jasper (Austin Amelio), the guy who usually plays the undercover role of a hitman, is suspended, and Claudette (Retta) and Phil (Sanjay Rao) co-opt Gary to fill in. Gary proves amazingly skilled at his job with his forgettable face, many disguises, and believable sales pitch. Nonetheless, Gary's ex-wife (Molly Bernard) encourages him to liven up his personality.Suddenly, Gary meets Madeline Masters (Adria Arjona), a beautiful young woman who wants to have her husband, Ray (Evan Holtzman), killed. Rather than trap her, Gary encourages her to flee her husband and begin her own life. Soon, Gary and Maddy begin a relationship in which she still believes Gary is a hitman, and Gary's police colleagues are unaware of his relationship with a potential suspect. The movie then unfolds through many twists and turns that threaten their relationship and their trust in one another.\"Hit Man\" is a supremely clever story loosely based on a real Gary Johnson in Houston. It has a romantic comedy edge against a film noir backdrop. Powell and Arjona have excellent chemistry. The script lags a little in the middle but sprints to the end and has a good film noir ending.",

The most interesting part of the film is actually the first act, when Glen Powell gets to shine in a diverse portfolio of characters, including a long, gritty dialogue exchange.

It also has a very smart script, playing with ideas of identity and being your true self.

        "description": "Hitman is definitely a film-lover's paradise but even the casual film viewer will thoroughly enjoy this brilliant new movie. Linklater's latest lovingly pays homage to film noir, screwball comedy, Hitchcockian black comedy and even the good old psychosexual drama but it still somehow manages to conjure up a fresh, witty and often uproarious confection that frequently teases, delights and occasionally thrills the audience with frissons of excitement, keeping them enraptured all the way to its deliciously razor sharp ending.This is potentially a star-making turn for Glen Powell. Although he made a strong impression in Top Gun: Maverick as a cocky rival pilot, his role in Hit Man is easily more complex and, as the co-writer of the script, he has been able to add brilliant layers to his character, or should that be characters? In effect, Powell is playing more than one character - Gary Johnson, mild-mannered, cat-loving geeky Psychology professor and audio techie who moonlights as a surveillance expert for a Louisana-based police unit that targets and stings hapless ne'er-do-wells who are looking to hire a killer. Before the next sting operation, Gary's police colleague Jasper (Austin Amelio) who normally pretends to be the hired killer is suspended for brutally attacking two youths, which forces Gary's colleagues (brilliantly played by Retta and Sanjay Rao) into convincing Gary to take over from the universally loathed Jasper, much to Gary's dismay. Yet, within minutes of taking on the task, Gary suddenly morphs into \"Ron\" and during his first sting he is so convincing that his colleagues are shocked, even though they had believed he could do it having heard Jasper go through the rigamarole on previous occasions. It is a brilliant piece of acting.Having created the killer persona, Gary soon finds himself becoming more and more immersed in Ron, adding further, chameleon-like layers of disguise and character traits to mirror whoever is about to be stung. However, things become really complicated (in true film noir style) when \"Ron\" is approached by a femme fatale, Maddy (beautifully played by Adria Ajrona who also adds a delightfully a kooky sexy edge as well as a tender vulnerability). As the sparks between the two begin to fly during a hilarious but flirty exchange, Gary, who is clearly enjoying himself as Ron, finds himself conflicted. Dare he. As Ron, continue with the sting and have Maddy arrested for plotting to murder her husband? Has the flirtatious exchange caused Maddy to betray some regrets about what she is doing? The chemistry between Powell and Arjona is a pleasure to witness. Both actors bring out the best in one another and it is thrilling.Off-beat is an expression that would certainly apply to Hit Man - and it is a compliment. It is also one of the most enjoyable and fun 2 hours I've had in the cinema in the past few years. I absolutely adore this film.",

The plot is overly slight, and the direction it goes is bizarre, especially the ending, which felt rushed and contrived. The plot does not develop in a manner which extracts full potential of comedy from its situation, and neither is it particularly entertaining. Also, Despite what some critics have praised, I could not see much chemistry between Arjona and Powell. Sure, they are both more than serviceable in their roles, and they share several steamy scenes, but there is no special spark or unique connection between the two. At the end of the day, I find Hit Man very similar to The Fall Guy, a movie released at around the same time. Both are serviceable, fun, and entertaining distractions which can barely hold and audiences attention for two hours.

And the ending was quite satisfying, even if I didn't entirely expected it!The great pacing takes you along and you start to accept the path you are walking alongside these characters. Haven't watched a recent movie that makes me want to recommend this to everyone I know.. kind of has a Mr Brooks vibe to it.",

I don't know, maybe I'm still frustrated that Boyhood received such critical acclaim for being so basic and uninspiring, but yet a really cool idea for a movie, just poorly executed. Okay this isn't about Boyhood, but I find this Director pretentious in his story telling, anyway, this is a decently interesting movie and I liked it overall, except I'd rather see those two in prison at the end, just another way to explain away one's desires and passions without accountability.

        "description": "My first experience with Glenn Powell was his supporting role in Top Gun: Maverick. He's been around much longer but he was good at playing the brash and cocky Hangman. He's been noteworthy in previous efforts (Hidden Figures was also mentioned by one of my friends) but I was blown away by his work in Hit Man, not only is he fantastic as the suave and smooth Ron but he's also convincing as the reserved and stale Gary (I do have some thoughts on how they present Gary, more on that later). But watching him in Hit Man, it felt like I was watching someone doing acting gymnastics, he's playing so many different and bizarre characters and he nailed every single one. He also has great chemistry with his co-star Adria Arjona, I was just as interested in the their torrid romance than I was in what costume Gary was going to shuffle into next. Speaking of Adria, her work in this was also noteworthy, it would have been easy to make assumptions about Madison's character if Adria's performance didn't make her so mysterious and alluring. She's beautiful, she got her fair share of laughs from me and I was surprised at how invested I was in Gary and Madison's relationship by the end of the movie. I also wanted to credit Austin Amelio, Retta and Sanjay Rao for their collective work in their supporting parts. Another expectation the movie subverts is painting Jasper as a two dimensional villain, Austin makes Jasper unlikeable but not inhuman or not believable as Gary's dejected co-worker.Besides the performances, my favourite part of Hit Man was how it subverts the formula. I can't call it wholly and completely original but I was constantly trying to guess the next twist or shift in the narrative based on similar films. Hit Man continued to zag when I expected it to zig and it's so well layered. Director Richard Linklater and his team have a sense of when they need to switch things up, just when the movie gets too goofy, we get more time with Ron & Madison bonding or when you're about to guess when a twist will happen, the movie will suddenly get much darker. There's several tones at play but they are mixed together so precisely that it kept me entertained when I feel like another movie would have lost me.So many movies are \"based\" on a true story and sure enough, Hit Man isn't the unvarnished truth up on the screen. But the movie is cognizant of the fatigue that comes with this claim and admits it upfront. It helps that the true story is so fantastical that I wasn't bothered in how they tweaked it. Despite the changes, Hit Man is so good natured and seems to being celebrating Gary's unbelievable skill set that I didn't get bogged down in what was true and what wasn't.Hit Man slowly builds toward the finale and despite climax being morally murkier and darker tinged than I maybe expected, I loved how the ending punctuated what was a hugely enjoyable film. I was rooting for Gary/Ron and Madison despite what was revealed about them and it's captured wonderfully by Linklater. The movie doesn't pause to scold you for being sympathetic to one party or another and I liked that it wasn't too concerned with the absolute morality of the characters. The film ends with a metaphorical wink to the audience and it felt like a chef's kiss on a delicious meal.I'm going to be brief about any griping, My only problem is that they don't do a wholly convincing job of dressing Glen Powell down to be the nerdy and shy Gary Johnson when he's just being himself. It's reminiscent of sitcoms slapping glasses on models to trying to present them as dowdy. When everyone is making jokes about how \"normal\" and \"unassuming\" Gary looks, I rolled my eyes a little. But I guess Glen Powell being too handsome to be terribly convincing as a geek college professor is a nice problem to have.Hit Man was such a pleasant surprise, I felt like I was taking a gamble taking friends to see it in the theatre with me but we all walked out impressed. It made me a little sad that it was simultaneously released on Netflix, this is a theatre quality movie and while I understand it might have had a tougher road to profitability than your typical summer tentpole, it earned my ticket price. The film is so much fun, Glen Powell and Adria Arjona light up the screen and the fact that it's based on a true story is just delightful (I loved the end credits joke on how they changed the story). I tip my hat to Powell, Linklater & his team and the real Gary Johnson, I had a great time with Hit Man. I'd rate this at an 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9/10 and while you should check it out on Netflix, you won't regret going to see it in theatres either.",

        "description": "Richard Linklater's (Before Sunrise trilogy, Boyhood) latest film is getting very good reviews so it's quite a surprise once you see it that it's average at best. One of the reasons for that is the lack of variety and emotion Glen Powell puts in (or doesn't) in his performance. There should be a duality between his build-up cocky Ron hit man persona and Gary, his softer, nerdier, normal day-to-day self. Yet, when he supposedly switches between one and the other there's no real substantial difference between the two besides a cosmetic one. One would think this would be the role to show his acting prowess but there seems to be very little and this is nowhere near Bryan Cranston's duality performance skills as Walter White in Breaking Bad if we were to compare an actors task of switching between two sides of a character.There's never any palpable tension in Gary/Ron, he's always in control. He's in control when he becomes the face of the supposed hit-man for the first time (no nervousness, nothing), he is in control when everything starts to unravel, he's in control when he's being confronted with his actions during the climax of the film, and so on - and the film suffers very much from it as we never go along with the main character or actually worry about him, as the main actor never really does anything with it.Likewise, it's a bit boring at times, the cinematography is beyond plain and it's very predictable. The film would have been so much better had it been more stylised, with a more substantial visual flair and a cool soundtrack at least to cover its flaws, since overall there's not really much meat to the story and the film ends up being about nothing.",

The first entire 2/3 of this is a slog and a jumble of implausible and boring events, the it rises very slightly and briefly when the aforementioned One Good Scene occurs, only to divebomb very hard into a completely incomprehensibly ruinous ending.

We as a viewer saw no romantic or loving conversations in which they got to know each other better and I suppose that's part of the story with Gary being a supposed hitman and all, but it just makes the eventual romance seem sudden and odd.She then decides to drug a cop(!) in her own house(!!), Gary's just okay with it, finishes the job and it just fades into another sex scene and then fast forwards to where they have a happy family. You're telling me they killed a cop on the spot without any planning and alibis and got away with it? I really didn't expect this so called action comedy to end like that.",

        "description": "\"Hitman,\" directed by Richard Linklater, is an intriguing yet uneven journey that offers glimpses of potential but ultimately falls short of being a memorable cinematic experience. Based on a true story, the film features commendable performances, particularly from Glen Powell, but suffers from a lack of character development and emotional depth.Glen Powell delivers a standout performance, embodying his character with a mix of charm and authenticity that makes him a compelling figure to watch. His nuanced portrayal brings a layer of believability to the narrative, making the moments of action and subtle humor particularly enjoyable. Powell's ability to infuse his role with both intensity and a touch of levity is one of the film's highlights.The movie does offer a few humorous moments that provide a welcome break from the otherwise serious tone. These lighter scenes are well-executed and add a layer of entertainment, making the film a decent choice for those looking for a casual watch. However, the humor alone is not enough to compensate for the film's more significant shortcomings.One of the primary issues with \"Hitman\" is its lack of character development. Despite the film being based on a true story, the characters feel underdeveloped and one-dimensional. There is a noticeable absence of emotional depth, which makes it difficult for the audience to connect with or care about the characters on a deeper level. This lack of character growth and exploration is a missed opportunity that could have elevated the film from being merely good to something truly impactful.Richard Linklater's direction, while competent, fails to fully capitalize on the story's potential. The narrative feels rushed at times, and the pacing issues detract from the overall impact of the film. There are moments that hint at deeper emotional and psychological layers, but these are never fully explored, leaving the audience with a sense of incompleteness.In conclusion, \"Hitman\" is a film that is good for passing the time but doesn't leave a lasting impression. Glen Powell's strong performance and the film's occasional humor make it worth a watch, but the lack of character development and emotional depth prevent it from being anything more than a mildly entertaining diversion. With a more nuanced approach to storytelling and character development, \"Hitman\" could have been much more impactful.",

'Hit Man' somehow achieves the opposite - it's a fluffy confection inspired by the real-life exploits of a psychology professor who masquerades a professional hit man while moonlighting for the police department. Gary Johnson carries out this pretense in order to entrap those looking to hire an assassin.The film's introductory sequences show restaurant encounters where he convinces several would-be murderers he's a hardened criminal in the liquidation business. These meetings are recorded, and the conspirators arrested after clearly stating their intent and handing over a down-payment. Linklater's narrative departs from reality when a beautiful Latina asks him to terminate her abusive husband. To the confusion of his handlers, Gary refuses her payment, and suggests she initiate divorce proceedings instead of contracting a homicide. Needless to say, complications ensue when he secretly starts an affair with her while maintaining his killer-for-hire persona.'Hit Man' could have followed in the footsteps of modern classics like 'Body Heat', but Linklater chooses to play it for light comedy rather than drama. Tension is lost as the proceedings become increasingly frivolous and unlikely. The acting performances and amusing screenplay just about hold one's interest, but the end-result feels like an insubstantial appetizer that could have been a memorable main course with a different approach.",

        "description": "The hitman is already for a long time a popular character in crime and (neo) noir films. For me the ultimate hitman-film is \"The day of the jackal\" (1973, Fred Zinnemann). In this film Edward Fox plays a hitman that is professional, emotionless and a typical loner.Only the last description does apply to Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) in \"The hit man\". He is however not a real hit man but an undercover hit man. He meets people looking for a hit man and makes sure the compromising evidence is on tape.In order to do this he changes outfit all the time and this leads to a comic costume parade, including an imitation of Anton Chigur (Javier Bardem), the hit man from \"No country for old men\" (2007, Ethan & Joel Coen).Being partly a comedy, \"Hit man\" is an odd one in the oeuvre of director Richard Linklater, who is mostly known for his \"Before .... \" relation trilogy (1995, 2004,2013) and his coming of age film \"Boyhood\" (2014).\"Hit man\" really takes of when Gary Johnson falls in love with one of his clients (Maddy Masters played by Adria Arjona). It is the starting point of a roller coaster of numerous unexpected twists and turns.One of the themes is losing sight of the difference between your undercover \"me\" and your real \"me\". It happens in numerous film, but it also happens in reality. In an investigation from 1994 - 1996 the Dutch parliament studied how it happened by the police while combatting organized crime.The fact is however that Gary Johnson has two real \"me's\", one as a part-time police officer and one as a professor in philosophy. The last one delivers the philosophical theme of the movie of how to find a satisfactory balance between ratio and discipline (represented by the Greek God Apollo) and feeling, emotions, instincts and living dangerously (represented by the Greek God Dionysus).Remarkable is that where his most famous films (The \"Before\" trilogy and \"Boyhood\") are typical for an Apollonian world, \"Hit man\" descends to the depths of Dionysus.By the way, \"Hitman\" is in my opinion not very flattering for women, showing how they prefer the sex appeal of a hit man to that of a \"dull\" police officer (let alone a nerdy professor).",

The more of these cases he does, the better he gets; the more fun he has dressing up and adept he becomes at assuming a range of identities.

I find various movies these days don't offer this type of respect to real people or events and the idea of adding fantasy elements and blending them with reality results in some people believing it entirely.

It's the kind of story that, much like Edgar Wright's Baby Driver or Shaun of the Dead, would've made for a mediocre movie if directed by an amateur, but made for a great movie because it was directed by an experienced industry professional. All Linklater films are good films.This film keeps you guessing from beginning to end and tells its story in a way that makes the audience feel like they are learning and growing along with the characters. A great example of this is when the film periodically cuts back to Glen Powell's character, Gary Johnson, lecturing students on the everyday behaviors of people. Gary casually and subtly uses his experience as an undercover investigator as the building blocks for these lessons. By doing this, Gary is also introducing and breaking down the overarching themes of the film. It truly is brilliant storytelling.There will never be enough words to properly commend the actors in this film. They brought so much life and enthusiasm to their characters in constant battle between show stealers. In this battle, there were no winners or losers. The acting was balanced and cast members complimented their costars exquisitely.Linklater and Powell's writing was entertaining, truly comedic, well paced, and extremely thoughtful. It is definitely a must see for film buffs searching for depth and those just looking for a fun surface-level comedy. It does both properly in all respects.",

        "description": "Hit Man is a new action comedy directed, written and produced in part by Richard Linklater, director of Boyhood and Before Midnight.Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) is a school teacher, but also secretly works for the police. At one point he has to play a fake hitman with the police. He is hired by clients to commit murders, but after clients confess their criminal plans to Gary, the police can arrest them.When Madison Masters (Adria Arjona) wants to hire Gary, he falls for her beauty. This causes him to break his own rules and try to change Madison's mind so that she does not carry out criminal plans. The two fall in love, but Madison actually falls for the hitman Ron, who played Gary for her. On the other hand, Gary shouldn't show that he's broken his own code to Madison because it could get him in trouble with the police and ruin his career.This film is based on a true story, where the real Gary Johnson posed himself to the police as a hitman who criminals could hire to commit murders. Only after sharing their murderous plans with Gary could the police catch them. The real Gary Johnson had to dress up so many times, wearing different styles of clothes and wigs to appear different to each criminal, so he couldn't be exposed as an undercover cop. Glen Powell also does the same at the beginning of the film. He wears different costumes and also acts in different ways. For example, the film starts off more like an action comedy, but when Gary falls for Madison, the film turns more into a romantic comedy.Richard Linklater provides a comic action film, but with repeated events, where Gary, in different disguises, makes various criminals confess. When the film later turns more into a romantic comedy, this mainly works because of the good chemistry between Glen Powell and Adria Arjona, their characters. Glen Powell only plays a character who leads a double life and his character ends up in a relationship with the possible criminal. This creates complicated situations in which he has to continue working strategically, without Madison or the police realizing that he is actually lying to both of them. However, the film does have a somewhat abrupt ending, which does not seem to answer everything.Glen Powell plays the lead role well and actually has to play the role in different ways. This gives him the opportunity to show different acting capabilities in this film. Adria Arjona also plays the role of a seductive, possible criminal well, because as a viewer, like the main characters, you do not always know whether she can be completely trusted. After his time in various Walking Dead series, Austin Amelio also gets the chance to act in a film. He plays a colleague of the main character, who may thwart his strategic plans if he is told too much.",

It was easy to believe he was each person he played because he did such a great job with each one.Adria Arjona also delivers a very convincing performance. Her character although not changing physically like Glen Powell, does demonstrate a multi-dimensional persona. The relationship that develops between these two characters is both romantic and thrilling. The rest of the cast is also good without a single flawed performance.There are some interesting psychological ideas explored in this movie. Not only were the ideas interesting but so was the manner in which they were delivered. Glen Powell's character Gary essentially would speak to his students about certain psychological ideas while simultaneously exploring these ideas as a hitman.Overall, this was a well written and interesting story. It's a good blend of comedy, romance and crime.",

They are completely dazzling together, and the ridiculous situation they find themselves in is beautifully choreographed by Richard Linklater, who directs them into and out of moments that'll have you amused and confounded simultaneously.This is one of the better \"new\" movies I have seen in a long time, and I have absolutely no problem highly recommending this. I wish Hollywood made more films like this, and I'll be perusing Linklater's catalogue to see what other hidden gems might be in lurking in there.

        "description": "Hit Man is a very average experience with an admittedly entertaining premise, providing few laughs and a sudden love story that hijacks the plot.This movie's pacing was very uneven, with the first 20 minutes of introductions and little setup not only felt hollow but also like it could've been shortened to 5-10 minutes, and the actual plot doesn't really get going until about 30 minutes in too. Glen Powell gives a pretty good performance of acting dorky and kinda introverted, yet it feels like most of that is because his glasses are doing most of the acting for him. He's able to play a fun variety of hit men, but that isn't really the central focus. Adria Arjona is pretty good at the love interest with what could best be described as innocently dark intentions.The jokes from many of the side characters didn't really work for me, most notably Gary's two police associates, played by Retta and Sanjay Rao. There seemed to be some kind of underlying message about how we're all capable of change in one way or another, but I feel like that was included to justify the surprisingly dark yet underwhelming ending this movie pulls.Overall, there's not much to say about Hit Man, aside from being an occasionally darkly humorous and empty movie that you'd put on when you don't want to think too hard.",

And the ending kinda took out all the good things (however much measly amount they were) away for sure. Because these things surely will give hope to someone that u can get away from a wrong doing and live happily ever after.As for acting, Glen really has the unreadable face with one or two expressions which worked in his favor in this movie. But Adria. You know those actresses in B or C grade movies where their acts immediately tell u they are fishy and acting and with no subtlety trying to pry information outta u and batting eyelashes to make u do something, her acting in this movie belongs in that category. Anytime she was on screen, i had to endure a fake performance.There was barely any action, any comedy and romantic romance, so defining which genre this one belongs to is hard.

Plus it is based loosely on a true story, which I usually find elevates my interest.That said, it isn't going to blow you away, doesn't do anything new and isn't particularly memorable. I can't fault the performances, and it is a fun enjoyable watch, which is worth viewing at home. I did get a bit of an insight into a whole 'world' of detective work that is legal and I was shocked by how scarily common it is for a spouse, or disgruntled friend/relation/colleague/rival to attempt to set up a hitman to kill.Having since read a bit about the guy upon whom this film's main character is based, his 'success' is undeniable. The parallel lives he led is impressive and fascinating. The statistics we are given on screen are accurate. But, it does become rather a farfetched plot and in some cases of 'based on true events' films I've really felt 'truth can be stranger/more wild than fiction '.However, in the case of Hitman, the twists and turns the story takes are fictional, and discovering this was slightly disappointing but I guess it also makes me feel they did a good job at using a true character and expanding/fleshing out an entertaining yarn!I'd love to see a documentary on this guy, and/or a different director/filmmakers create a more serious, exploration of him or other people who work undercover, and the impact this has upon their psyche, relationships, and the type of person who can actually live a life like this.",

One thing leads to another and things go wrong and that makes the rest of this 'dark-thriller comedy' story.This seems like a couple friends having an idea, coming up with the screenplay, one directs and produces it and the other acts in it. This is what you'd come up with your friend, nothing over the top but still entertaining enough.While there's nothing GREAT about it, the writing and the chemistry between Glen and Adria sell the film well.

        "description": "\"The eternal mystery of human consciousness and behavior.\" Gary Johnson (Glen Powell)Having just enjoyed a summer stroll through an arts festival, I settled for another breezy summer evening with Glen Powell as a nerdy and hot professor and hitman, thanks to the Netflix trick of playing its crime soft and its romance, well, plainly romantic.Promising some truth in the telling, Hitman is based on a feature in Texas Monthly about Gary Johnson, a college philosophy teacher (see the above quote about his interest) who also moonlights with the local police as an ersatz hitman, nailing scores of bad apples looking to hire an assassin usually for reasons of love gone badly. Gary, wearing multiple disguises for his wildly different clients, can further enhance his lectures on the self: \"What if your self is a construct?\" he asks his students.Gary remains an operative who never kills anyone until he meets comely client, Maddy (Adria Arjona), and is drawn into a caper as Ron and lover, possibly becoming at least an accomplice to murder. Meanwhile, director Richard Linklater, who knows a thing or two about actors as lovers, weaves the romance with college lectures on identity and psychological self-styling, common threads in our social-media landscape. Our ability to create our own persona on Facebook or Snapchat, for example, is not unlike his profession, but not quite as dangerous, mostly.You don't need to know Nietzsche to believe that a mild-mannered professor could play a hit man (a student exclaims, \"When did our teacher get hot?\") or that anyone could construct a personality with the help of the Internet. The film becomes more than an amusing thriller as identities play a key role in furthering a promising romance or solving a crime that has murder as a centerpiece.Although more than once it's claimed there are no hitmen now or in history, Hit Man goes a long way in convincing us that they could be real. In more than one extended dialogue, Gary/Ron explains the complexity and allure of switching identities.Hit Man has its own double identity-cool summer caper and dangerous romance, both threatened by electronic surveillance and the human capability of shifting its persona throughout life. Although the subject of identity crafting involving the id, the ego, and the superego can't be adequately discussed in a brief TV melodrama, Hit Man does give one pause. And a brisk summer breeze.",

First the obvious, is it a good story that people want to hear. Check.

It simultaneously leads the audience effortlessly, from one plot point to the next all while throwing curve balls the whole way so we don't know where to look. Truly a fun ride to take.The acting is good on all fronts with special nod to Glen for having fun with multiple characters. Not much negative to discuss. Hit Man does drag a bit in the middle after starting strong but finishes even stronger. That is the key to rewatchability I think, a strong finish.

She had already done so with Gary, which caused him to freak out and give up his fake identity as 'Ron' the hitman. Quite honestly, I can't imagine how the guy was able to make with a comeback for every prospective client who was looking to have someone eliminated. The guy never said the wrong thing and had an answer for every eventuality. Talk about thinking on one's feet!So even though this picture might have been based on a true story, the whole thing had an air of incredulity about it. Getting back to the real Gary Johnson, he assisted in the arrests of more than 70 people seeking contract killers using aliases when it suited his purpose. The Madison Masters character was based on a woman that Johnson referred to social services and a therapist to get the help she needed to end an abusive relationship.

Glen Powell's fans will especially enjoy his charm and energy. The film's upbeat nature makes it a good choice for a casual movie night. However, the disparity in acting abilities among the cast is noticeable and somewhat diminishes the film's potential. If all the actors had matched Powell's level of performance, the movie could have been much better.In conclusion, while I'm not a huge fan of Glen Powell, I can appreciate his strong performance in this film. I hope future projects feature a more balanced ensemble cast to complement his talents. Thanks for reading my review, and I hope you all enjoy the movie despite its flaws!",

        "description": "Believe the hype: Richard Linklater and Glen Powell's Hit Man is awesome! It's a slick, sexy screwball comedy about identity that only a filmmaker like Richard Linklater could properly pull off! I'd say this might even be the must see romantic dark comedy of the decade! Hit Man is definitely a film-lover's paradise but even the casual film viewer will thoroughly enjoy this brilliant new movie. Linklater's latest lovingly pays homage to film noir, screwball comedy, Hitchcockian black comedy and even the good old psychosexual drama but it still somehow manages to conjure up a fresh, witty, and often uproarious confection that frequently teases, delights, and occasionally thrills the audience with frissons of excitement, keeping them enraptured all the way to its deliciously razor sharp ending. Go in blind - it's such a fun movie to experience with a crowd, knowing nothing of what's to come! I absolutely loved my experience watching this movie - it's a shame most people will experience it on Netflix for the first time. But because this movie is so unique and fun to experience knowing nothing about it - I'm gonna keep this short in order to preserve the experience of watching it for the first time! This film has been hyped up for months and yet it was still able to surpass everything I expected of it. This was some fresh, fun, effortless storytelling that works so well, and truly allows Glen Powell to ascend to a new level of movie stardom with such a charismatic performance! This is potentially a star-making turn for Glen Powell. Although he made a strong impression in Top Gun: Maverick as a cocky rival pilot, his role in Hit Man is easily more complex and, as the co-writer of the script, he has been able to add brilliant layers to his character, or should that be characters? His chemistry with the equally terrific Adria Arjona was dynamite, they both had true movie star energy! Both actors bring out the best in one another and it is thrilling! Hit Man is one of the most entertaining films of the year - a slick, cool, and hilarious crime film that deconstructs our notion of what a hitman is while simultaneously examining its lead character's ID, EGO, and SUPEREGO. This is Linklater at his most fun and effortless. A masterclass on direction, writing, and acting, Hit Man is a wild, entertaining ride that I can't wait to see many more times! I LOVED Hit Man, it left me with the biggest smile! It's a - hit, man!",

Glen Powell showed such diversity and intelligence in this role. He played a menagerie of people as an undercover hitman for the police department. He would pretend to be a hitman to expose people who had intent to have someone they know murdered. This was so well done.The scope of this plays from a psychological perspective and left me feeling light and fuzzy as our protagonist's relationship developed with our herione. This was such a playful bend on the stereotypical hitman movies that was so fun and different. Would definitely watch this again.",

        "description": "This movie has been so heavily talked up by some notable film critics no less that I was excited to give it a watch.The premise is simple enough. A philosophy professor moonlighting with a side gig assisting the NOLA Police Department who suddenly falls into the role of a lifetime when he fills in as a hit man for hire insn ongoing sting operation to thwart murder for hire plots. Much to everybody's surprise (himself included), it turns out he's really good at it.Along the way, he falls for a woman who initially comes to him to order a hit on her husband. Their chemistry unavoidable, he talks her out of it, they fall in love and then , in a sudden dark turn, she kills her husband. Yeah, she kills her husband.Rather than a moment of profound tonal shift into Coen Brotheresque neo-noir territory, the story continues apace along the same breezy pace before this shoulda been shocking event. There's no great reckoning. None. This would be weird for any character but for a philosophy professor with a deep regard for the moral clarity and ethics he espouses to his students in class all semester, it's particularly odd. Instead he lets it slide, comes clean with his love interest that he's really not a true hit man and in the process of participating in a murder to cover up the first murder effectively becomes the real thing.In more capable hands this could have been a classic slapdash 60s Cary Grant rom-com even with the unusual twist but it falls way short of anything especially comical or memorable. Like some of Linklater's other movies, there's a tonally flat quality that renders what should have been a really surprising transition little more than half baked and unnecessary. Whatever investment you've made in the characters feel like a waste.",

Powell plays Gary, a college professor of psychology and philosophy who moonlights, helping the police with electronic surveillance systems. When the main undercover cop is suspended, they ask Gary to step in. Now as Ron, he excels as a fake Hit Man and is asked by the police to get involved in many other set ups to catch out people looking to hire him to kill people. To do this he adopts disguises and identities to convincingly catch the targets out. One day though, looking to set up a young woman eager to kill her brutal husband, he falls for her and convinces her to back away. A romance begins which gets more and more complicated as he continues to play at being Ron.Fun stuff, which starts off as a straight comedy as he traps all sorts of eccentrics who want to kill husbands and wives etc. However, when the romance starts each scene ramps up the complications with the story becoming increasing dark and seemingly impossible for Gary to escape prison, get the girl etc. Powell is really good - truly now looking like a big star presence - looking at identity and whether it is possible to embrace a new one if required, in turn requiring him to play lots of different characters in order to catch the baddies. A good laugh, clever and worth seeing.",

They are:1) The audience should like your protagonists\n2) Have a good ending\"Hit Man\" breaks both rules. It pains me to say that, because 75% of the film I mostly enjoyed. I thought the leads acted well, good chemistry, etc.The film wasn't that funny, if it was trying to be a black comedy, which I \"think\" it was? But as a romantic film it was okay enough. Unfortunately the ending just wasn't well conceived.I thought the final act, as the cops closed in on Madison being a killer, was well set up. But the film decided to give Gary, the male lead, not only a different personality at the end of it all, but a completely different moral compass as well.I looked forward to the final scene between the protagonists, Gary and Madison, and their showdown with a dirty cop.Up to this point, Gary was portrayed as a likable enough guy who seemed to want to do the right thing, even if he occasionally bent the rules it was for the right reasons. Until, well until......Gary mysteriously transforms at the end of the film into a cold blooded cop killer. Who kills his colleague, in a completely blatant act. Just 180 degree turn in character. Was the sex \"that\" good?But besides being an out of character move, the twist makes the protagonists into negative characters, right at the end, so this becomes the lasting impression of them.Weirdly, I think the director frames the actions as strangely just, because Madison's husband \"might've been a jerk\", but this was never shown on screen. The murdered cop was also talked about as being a bad guy but he was never depicted as a bad guy on screen.So because we have to take the word of the characters that these people deserved to die, and that makes it okay?

The two leads are compelling attractive, but the quick-fire scenes used to build their on-screen romance felt tired and clichéd after the enjoyable run of scenes that preceded it, where we see Gary developing his hitman personas to suit his varied client base (with no shortage of intertextual references to other films with memorable killers).The movie picks up in the second half, culminating in one remorseless scene that brings together its themes and philosophy. It was enough to make up for the otherwise uncomfortable sense that the film was a slightly overlong apology for state-sanctioned murder and personal vigilante justice, disguised as a romantic comedy.I was left with the feeling that Hit Man could have been a much tighter, more engaging film if it was only about 25 minutes shorter.",

What happens when Gary posing as Ron gets to meet a client and it's love at first sight? What trouble he gets into and how does he come out of the situation, forms rest of the story.Richard Linklater narrates this particular story which shifts gear when it comes to varied genres and it definitely helps to have a charming lead. Gary loves his job and is happy taking care of his pets so when he does get offered to go undercover, he gives his 100% to turn into a fake hit man and an ordinary professor turning into this charmer, is a transition well executed. The humor filled dialogues help ease out even when things seems to get serious. This is a genre that made me want some bigger twist in the final act but Richard chose to be loyal in narrating Gary's story or to say, not that predictable as I expected the story to be.

Her chemistry with Powell is electric from their very first encounter and she makes her character empathetic whilst adding a sense of mystery to her character as their relationship develops.Richard Linklater is on top form here with understated direction that plays to his strengths. He has a way of making his films feel so warm, trundling along nicely in a way that's patient yet engrossing with characters who are a pleasure to spend 2 hours with.

        "description": "\"Hit Man\" is a decent watch, much like a Domino's pizza-enjoyable but but nothing to write home about.The plot is straightforward and one-dimensional. While the premise is fun, the jokes are too sparse. I didn't laugh out loud at any point, just had the occasional smile.The classroom scenes felt like they existed solely for exposition and to drive home the movie's message. The overall screenplay would have been tighter with just the initial exposition, cutting the other classroom scenes, bringing the runtime to a crisp 90 minutes.Overall, this is a decent one-time watch that will soon be forgotten in the sea of Netflix flicks.On a side note, Adria Arjona is stunning! I couldn't take my eyes off her throughout the movie. It's secretly the reason I'm rating this 7 instead of 6.",

Despite being an hour and 55 minutes long, makes you invested in the detail put into the characters was just amazing...\nGlenn Powell, Retta, Austin Emilio, Adria Arjona, and so many more brought life into the movie. The twists and turns holds you until the end...\nEven though the movie is comedic, the life lesson behind it is meaningful & laughter leaves you think positively...Powell's character Gary and Adria Arjona's character Madison; these two were incredible on screen and really made this film enjoyable with their acting and how they are around each other as characters and as their normal person...The twist about an hour into this film is quite unexpected and is very good in setting up the second half of the film; leaving the audience wanting to keep watching, pulling them in to the film itself. The ending was impeccable as well; this film was extremely unpredictable and loved it. Amazing directing and producing from all workers that put their time into this film...Richard Linklater, who co-wrote the screenplay with Powell and directed the film, probably did as well as expected with the money and talent he had to work with. Linklater knows how to tell good film stories, and he does so here because he has a good feel for his source material...Overall \"Hitman\"has the meet-cute, aha moment, montage, grand gesture, cheesy lines, and is sexy as hell...",

        "description": "This movie could have been titled \" The hitman who isn't \" or \" A different kind of hitman \" and both would have been fine. Definitely a novel plot where a quintessential University Professor Gary Johnson ( Glen Powell) who teaches psychology/ philosophy and whose hobby is tinkering with electronics lands up as an undercover agent with the local police department. He has the dubious job of trapping desparados who are ready to pay hitmen like him to eliminate people. He does well, the cops like him but his infatuation for a pretty female client creates problems for him and the police department. Things get messy when a murder takes place, an investigation is ordered and he is a suspect too.Director Richard Linklater had impressed me in \" Boyhood \" but this tale of intrigue and crime is totally a different ball game as far as narratives go. Nevertheless it is a riveting plot and the situations get murkier as the storyline unfolds. Glen Powell is at ease with the changing hues of the character he plays. (Interesting to note that he has collaborated as the writer with Linklater.) The movie could be termed as a dark thriller with the protagonist in a twin personality of the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde type. Adria Arjona as the love interest and Austin Amelio as the colleague have given strong support.",

I don't know why people so fuss about it and asking about realism in comedy movies is pointless.The movie starts very great with a fast pace until Madison joins, it uses so much time to focus on the sex scene and unnecessary lecture scenes. I think they try to deliver the philosophy part or want to explain why or how characters develop in movies, which people already know. It just makes the story not go smoothly, it has Gary do his job and then come to have sex with Madison 3 times just to let us know that She has the knowledge to set up a murder from the after-sex talk. Rather than develop an antagonist story. So all we got from Jasper is a villain who lost his job because of himself and can't get back because of Gary. And U know what the final scene when Jasper is defeated they just add a sex scene for no reason. But overall it's pretty funny and that is the whole purpose. It would be better if they added music to the movie or had better background music that suits the scene the entire movie is so quite so we could have some memorable things but I guess this is what you're gonna get from a Netflix movie in the theater.",

Two things happen to derail this film. First the plot takes a sharp turn, and the film suddenly becomes a romantic comedy. Second the lead actress in said romance gives one of the worst performance that I have ever seen. It's like we are airlifted out of charming crime thriller and dropped into one of the most awkward second acts I have ever watched. I don't know who this actress is but she is awful. She tries to be cute and silly but her performance just took me right out of the movie. For some reason, she makes the decision to use her bulging eyes as an Italian actor might use their hands. It's bizarre. Also, she is a murderer. So why would are leading man fall for a bug-eyed psychopath? The film doesn't explain this at all. Suddenly they're married with kids, and this ending is not happy. It feels tragic, as both of them have covered up murders. In romantic comedies you either pull for a couple to get together or you don't. In this one, the moment this actress comes on the thinking Gary Johnston should run for the hills.",

        "description": "After thinking for a bit I've finally found a way to describe how this movie felt to me: once I went to a BBQ hosted by a friend that was incredible - great food, great company, great location. But at the end he stood up with a projector and pitched us on joining his pyramid scheme. Thats what this movie feels like - its a hell of a ride but when you get to the end you cant help but feel like all the good was made to soften the blow of the terrible ending. At the end you start to realize it's really an hour and a half or so of great fun that's written to convince you to overlook the moral and emotional objections you're bound to have when the movie's over. But it doesn't work. The objections linger. And as much as I wish I wasn't, I was dissatisfied.Above all else Hit Man is entertaining. Glen Powell shows off a surprising range playing not only Gary, but all of Gary's made-up versions of himself. He's somehow able to covey believable emotion as different characters and still win us over as he navigates the morally ambiguous world of undercover sting operations. I was also very impressed by Adria Arjona who could solicit a hitman and still feel innocent and could be so seductive without it feeling camp. I have a feeling we'll be hearing her name everywhere soon enough. Overall the chemistry was undeniable and these core performances made the movie as enjoyable as it was.But the issue: Gary's problem, according to his ex wife in the beginning of the film, is that he wont change. And to her that's unfortunate because he's passionless and nerdy and stiff. So, throughout the movie as we watch him change into Ron we hear him teach his students about morality and the psychology of the self, which eventually leads him to the conclusion that moral absolutes don't exist and persistent personalities don't either - we can change who we are, we can change right and wrong, its all just contructs anyways. So, in the end he becomes a tough guy and a murderer. And we're supposed to be happy for him.If my girlfriend told me \"you need to change\" and I came back the next day as a psychopath she wouldnt thank me. She'd say \"thats not what I meant.\" Because any conversation about whether we can change is not just about change for change's sake. That was never the question. Gary's problem in the beginning of the film was that he needed personal growth and by the end he still didn't have it. He went from a nerdy guy who was antisocial in a not-talkative way to a cool guy who is antisocial in a clinical way.If they made it tongue in cheek that he'd become a murderer I could see it being passable because its edgy. We could say its satire. But they don't do that. It feels like they really believe that Gary did the right thing in the end. They don't treat him like the subject of a character study. They give him the happily ever after treatment like a hero. He kills his coworker so he can keep going steady with his secret friend with benefits, who also just confessed to murder. And then he says \"yeah that guy was kinda racist and misogynistic\" so we feel less bad about it. And then it cuts to him telling his students \"there are no absolutes.\" The absolute frustration I felt at the end of this movie got me thinking absolutes do exist.All in all I admit I enjoyed most of the movie. My advice is to watch it and then towards the end just pause it and make up an ending for yourself (thats just a social contruct, right? As Gary would say). Then you can have a great time and avoid the feeling someone is secretly trying to convince you to become a villain.P.",

One day, he is selected to work in a series of undercover sting operations, getting wire-tapped confessions from those planning on arranging contract killings. But things take a misfiring turn, when he ends up falling for one of his assignments, in the shape of Madison (Adria Arjona), a young woman at the behest of her abusive ex, only for things to take a massive turn when crooked agent Jasper (Austin Amelio) gets in on their arrangement.There was a film from 1997 called Grosse Pointe Blank, that received some critical acclaim at the time despite a limit in much of the way of a wide release. Writer/director Richard Linklater's film would seem to owe much of its inspiration to this source, and seems to be another well received subversive take on the 'hitman' genre, spinning conventional wisdom of the standard tropes of films featuring these characters on their head at one point, with a colourful montage of past films from this genre, from some of the oldest ones to more modern stuff like 2008's In Bruges.Linklater's film seems a confusing jumble of genres, with elements of action, comedy and thriller thrown into the mix, but somehow keeps you engaged with everything that's going on, an original, engaging film, with its sly, wise-cracking script never letting up, and never letting the pace sag. It helps that the cast are all relatively unknown, and so no one overshadows the script or film in itself. That said, lead stars Powell and Arjona are perfectly up to the job, Powell curiously convincing as a man who can alternate between mild mannered lecturer and guy caught up in the criminal underworld, whilst Arjona is a sultry seductress who serves as a perfect foil to everyone's plans.It's an unsteady combination of different genres, and as a result it sometimes comes off weirdly, most notably with a morally iffy ending that could leave you feeling funny. But somehow, it all works, and you're left with one of the most original and worthwhile efforts in a while. ****",

There were so many plot holes and unbelievable situations that made this a bad movie, despite best efforts from everyone involved.

The things that happen in the movie are unbelievable. The way Powell's character Gary starts to act once we find out what Madison really is doing is unbelievable. The movie completely falls apart when we find out the truth and the story becomes completely ridiculous at that point. Along with the silly \"The idea of You\", this movie and others being churned out have beautiful stars with great acting talent and sexy love scenes, but the scripts are stupid, poorly written and derivative. Cringed hard for the pilot fantasy scene. Hoping Powell's next movie will have a good script. The Brooke Shield's rom com was horrid as well - one of many terrible movies out there.

This is a twist I didn't expect to see and although - sure - it does indeed make things more difficult and sets up an amusing scene where Powell has to silently coach Arjona what to say while they're being listened to by the cops on his wire, are we really supposed to give her a pass for murder? I mean, she's cute, but not that cute!2. In order to cover up the fact that she murdered her husband Powell then proceeds to murder in cold blood the (admittedly annoying) cop who's figured out the truth and is trying to shake them down for the insurance money. Sure, he's not a nice guy, but our leads have committed TWO murders now and we're still supposed to be on their side?3. And then, to top it all off, instead of them both dying in an accident or getting their just desserts (not pie) in some other way... THEY JUST LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER on the insurance payout from murdering her husband!Seriously, whoever thought it was acceptable to make a comedy where both the main characters commit murder and then live happily ever after with no retribution whatsoever is a disturbingly morally deficient individual.And then the movie production company approved this and it gets an 85 review score on Metacrtitic?Am I losing my mind here, or is there something seriously wrong with the society we're living in these days?2/10 because Arjona is cute.",

Glen Powell seems to be quite \"hot\" right now (which his students will say too, towards the end of the movie) - getting a writing credit next to Linklater here too.This may suggest it is action, but there is very little in that department happening. There is quite the romance going on and discussions ... a lot of dialog. And a lot happening too (cat and dog persons behave - it's a movie).

        "description": "In Richard Linklater's Hit Man, philosophy lecturer Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) ponders the question of how many people truly know themselves. The film tells the story of Johnson working for the New Orleans Police Department as a fake hit man for its sting operations. He is an amiable, Honda Civic-driving, bird-watching Everyman in shorts and glasses, who turns out to be the perfect fake assassin. Despite his unreadable face, Gary gets the gig at a moment's notice because the usual guy got caught beating up teens and got himself a 120-day suspension. However, Gary is a natural and convincingly transforms into a badass as soon as he meets his mark. This is similar to the scene in Collateral where Jamie Foxx's mousy cabbie has to pose as Tom Cruise's stone-cold assassin and suddenly becomes a new man. Glen Powell's performance in Hit Man might make him a movie-star because it is at heart a fantasy. Gary plays a figure out of our collective imagination, playing a figure out of our collective imagination. He researches his clients beforehand and tailors his look for their expectations of a hit man, making up the character as he sees fit. He meets Madison (Adria Arjona), a terrified wife being tormented by an unstable, domineering husband. She tries to hire Gary, but he slyly convinces her to give up on the idea because he doesn't want her going to prison. They fall in love, but she thinks he's still \"Ron,\" the grizzled, open-collared killer who showed her some genuine compassion and impromptu life coaching. Gary also thinks he's Ron, or at least becomes Ron whenever he's with her, so much so that he's now a demon in bed. He has the instincts of a tougher guy when they're together, and when Madison's estranged husband spots them at a club and threatens them, Gary immediately pulls out a gun, Clint Eastwood-style, and backs him off. Hit Man is a film that deconstructs the concept of stardom by presenting a character we cannot be, and then making us believe we can be him. The film's amiable filmmaking and Powell's charming, self-aware swagger are infused with the idea that anything is possible, making the world seem open, malleable, and accepting. The auteur theory has been criticized for its lack of focus on the material, but Linklater's breeziness and generosity as a director work wonders in this film. It serves as a rebuke to other hit-man movies at Venice this year, such as David Fincher's The Killer and Harmony Korine's Aggro Dr1ft. Linklater's film feels genuinely fresh, with fun for the star and the audience. The film's overt philosophical digressions, such as Gary's lectures to his classes, are easygoing and lively. Linklater's gentle touch is his secret weapon, and Hit Man might be a masterpiece. The film's overt philosophical digressions, in the form of Gary's lectures to his classes, are equally easygoing and lively.",

        "description": "After passing through various festivals and having the presence of one of the great contemporary directors, Hit Man was preceded by a great reception and the truth is that it is confirmed once we see what will surely be among the best films of the year when we make the final count.A highly professional director like Richard Linklater is possibly the great secret weapon for making this film work the way it does, taking into account that in other hands it will most likely not have the same satisfaction that one gets. A director who has known how to provide great black comedies, once again achieves the task of satisfying us as viewers with an intelligent, well-thought-out and very well-structured film, which in turn leads you to immediately connect with a story that seems to be going too slowly, but That, just like its protagonist, makes an immediate click and we don't realize how deeply we are immersed in a plot that captivates us as each dialogue passes.Also for everything to work perfectly we need effective protagonists and Glen Powell shows everyone that he is an actor who is efficiently reaping his current moment of recognition, beyond the physical appearance, he is also a very good actor and Here we can see it in all its dimension and in all its aspects that allow it to shine from beginning to end. In that same place we can leave Adria Arjona, who possibly gives one of her strongest performances to date, complementing herself and sharing her level with her co-star without having to reproach an actress who is on the rise. Two incredibly well-written and very well-acted characters with whom it is impossible not to have a connection with them.It is such an intelligent film that hides behind its title all the deception that its characters possess, it is a clever and hilarious comedy that incredibly in its dialogues hides the best weapon to provide you with the most absolute entertainment so far this year. We are left with a sexy and ingenious proposal that is positioned as an entertaining proposal beyond the explosions and chases. A captivating comedy that dares to narratively go beyond the commonplaces that logic might presume. The Linklater style is more than present in the one that also elevates a new Hollywood star like Glen Powell.A satisfactory film in all its aspects that crosses different genres without clashing in any of them and allowing itself to establish itself as one of the most refreshing proposals so far in 2024. It deserves to be seen and enjoyed and to indulge in the fun of an original proposal , conquering, exciting and perfectly achieved.",

Because this film is utterly hilarious in a way that feels referential to other films that we've seen before but it still feels like its own vision. Glen Powell is basically perfect in this role and I loved still managing to feel invested in his journey despite becoming more and more conflicted by the actions that he takes. As a crime thriller it's totally effective and as a dark comedy it's utterly hilarious. Despite the fact that I felt the core story could've been stronger I was always interested to see where it went next.I'm already very excited to see it again and as of now it's one of the best original movies that Netflix has put out.",

He has also worked part-time with the New Orleans Police Department as a technical advisor on some undercover operations. Suddenly, Jasper (Austin Amelio), the guy who usually plays the undercover role of a hitman, is suspended, and Claudette (Retta) and Phil (Sanjay Rao) co-opt Gary to fill in. Gary proves amazingly skilled at his job with his forgettable face, many disguises, and believable sales pitch. Nonetheless, Gary's ex-wife (Molly Bernard) encourages him to liven up his personality.Suddenly, Gary meets Madeline Masters (Adria Arjona), a beautiful young woman who wants to have her husband, Ray (Evan Holtzman), killed. Rather than trap her, Gary encourages her to flee her husband and begin her own life. Soon, Gary and Maddy begin a relationship in which she still believes Gary is a hitman, and Gary's police colleagues are unaware of his relationship with a potential suspect. The movie then unfolds through many twists and turns that threaten their relationship and their trust in one another.\"Hit Man\" is a supremely clever story loosely based on a real Gary Johnson in Houston. It has a romantic comedy edge against a film noir backdrop. Powell and Arjona have excellent chemistry. The script lags a little in the middle but sprints to the end and has a good film noir ending.",

Of course just looking at her it is pretty easy to do so, Spoilers ahead: Do they end up together? Yes they do ( although people get killed like her abusive husband and a crooked cop). I am a huge fan of the ending where they are married with children ( and still in love with each other). Why? I despise ambiguous endings.

Now I can understand if this was a slasher type file you have senseless killings but for a romantic comedy something is definitely not quite right here.",

        "title": "\"Hit Man\": A Neo-Noir Masterpiece in Exploring Identity and Morality",
        "date": "11 June 2024",
        "description": "Known for his distinct storytelling style and vision, director Richard Linklater has returned once again with his latest film, \"Hit Man\", a neo-noir genre that highlighted Linklater's keen observations on human nature. The film stars Glen Powell as Gary Johnson, a seemingly strait-laced professor who leads a double life as a fake hitman for the New Orleans Police Department with a mission to capture these frustrated murderers. Gary's unique talent for adopting various guises and personalities enables him to trap those who wish to eliminate someone. However, his professional and ethical boundaries came to blur when he was contacted by Madison, played by Adria Arjona, to hire him to kill her husband. As Madison falls for one of Gary's personas---the sexy Ron---their steamy relationship ignites a series of play-acting, deception, and escalating stakes.The most effective aspect of the movie lies in the moral and psychological dilemma faced by the protagonist, Gary. As a professor, he teaches ethical principles promotes clear-cut notions of right and wrong, and identifies yourself. Yet, his secret activities forced him to navigate a morally ambiguous persona, creating a stark contrast between his personal and professional undercover work. This contradiction sets the stage for profoundly exploring his identity and ego. Gary's struggle to separate his true self from the various personas he adopts adds another layer to his characterization. This internal conflict is vividly shown, making viewers think about what really shapes our identity and how it changes based on the different roles we play in life and the different people we interact with.The main concept of the movie is the five-factor model of personality--- extraversion, neuroticism, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. This framework created another layer to the main character's emotional depth. Throughout the film, Gary has presented different types of personas and it begs the question as to where amongst the five factors does his personality change belong. This idea isn't just interesting but also makes the story deeper, offering a lot to think about for anyone curious about psychology and how characters develop. It makes you wonder about how flexible our identities can be and how outside events shape who we are, adding a unique psychological twist to the movie.The screenplay is also one of the movie's greatest strengths. Co-written by Richard Linklater and Powell, the movie serves as a masterclass in the simplicity and ingenuity of the script. In general, movies don't have to rely heavily on grand and over-the-top dramatic twists, and this is where \"Hit Man\" excels. The screenplay focuses on the nuanced character development and clever plot turns that allow the audience to be continually engaged. The writing in this movie is very tight, witty, and full of subtle surprises, despite having some pacing issues in the first two acts, the movie's clever script and engaging dialogues make it compelling and fun to watch. Powell's involvement in the screenplay is a pleasant surprise for me as well, this showcases his versatility beyond acting and proving his capability as a writer.Glen Powell's performance is nothing short of a revelation. To be honest, one of my worries in this movie is Glen Powell, I fear that he might just be another boy next door, potentially making his performance less convincing. However, Powell dispels these doubts with his multifaceted portrayal of Gary and his various personas. His ability to seamlessly transition from one character to another, each with its own unique charm and complexity, is genuinely impressive. The chemistry between Powell and Arjona adds another layer of intensity and sensuality to the film. Their dynamic as actors embodies a dark and romantic comedy vibe that fits well within the neo-noir genre which allows the narrative to be very enriching and emotionally deep.Despite its strength, the movie is far from perfect. The pacing in the first and second acts can feel sluggish, as the narrative takes its time to build up Gary's undercover exploits. This slow and gradual build-up can be very overwhelming to some viewers, making you question the direction of the story and where it's heading. The film spends a considerable amount of time establishing Gary's various personas, and in the 2nd half, the relationship buildup between Gary and Madison is overtly done. However, as the movie progresses and once we've reached the 3rd act, the movie brings clarity and resolution, tying together the movie's themes and character arcs in a satisfying conclusion. At 1 hour and 50 minutes, the movie could have benefited from tighter editing to maintain a more consistent pace and keep the audience more engaged throughout.Overall, \"Hit Man\" has all the elements of a perfect film-smart writing, good performances, and an unusual Bonnie and Clyde love story. The writing is clever, simple, and with the right amount of twists that work seamlessly with the material. It stands out as a crowd-pleasing addition to the neo-noir genre and is a testament to Richard Linklater's skillful storytelling. Despite its pacing issues, the film ultimately delivers a compelling narrative that resonates with audiences. Glen Powell's performance and the clever exploration of identity make \"Hit Man\" a memorable and thought-provoking cinematic experience. The film's visual style is another standout feature, with Linklater's keen eye for detail creating a world that feels both grounded and surreal. The New Orleans setting provides a rich, atmospheric backdrop that complements the film's themes of deception and identity. The cinematography captures the city's moody, noir-esque ambiance, adding another layer of depth to the narrative.In true Richard Linklater fashion, \"Hit Man\" is a home run, solidifying its place in his impressive filmography. The film's unique blend of psychological depth, moral ambiguity, and romantic intrigue makes it a standout in the neo-noir genre, offering a narrative that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally engaging.In conclusion, \"Hit Man\" is a film that succeeds on multiple levels. It is a smart, engaging, and thought-provoking addition to the genre, with strong performances, a compelling narrative, and a unique exploration of identity and morality. Richard Linklater and Glen Powell have created a film that is both entertaining and intellectually stimulating, proving that the neo-noir genre still has plenty of room for innovation. Whether you're a fan of Linklater's previous work or new to his filmography, \"Hit Man\" is a film that is sure to leave a lasting impression.",

        "description": "Directed and written by Richard Linklater. A runtime of one hour and fifty-five minutes. Streaming on Netflix with an R rating.\"Gary Johnson,\" played by Glen Powell, is a bit of a loner. He's a professor teaching general psychology, but in his spare time, he works with the local police force. Doing of all things being a fake hitman.It didn't always start that way. At first, he only worked on the technical side of things. Working with \"Phil,\" played by Sanjay Rao, \"Claudette,\" played by Retta, and \"Jasper,\" played by Austin Amelio. \"Jasper\" who you might remember from playing \"Dwight\" in \"The Walking Dead\" was the head undercover officer playing a hitman.When \"Jasper,\" who is a scumbag, got suspended, they needed someone on the fly to help. \"Gary\" was forced on the spot to fill in for \"Jasper.\" A decision that affected his life forever.Being better than even \"Jasper\" was, which was a shock to everyone. Plus he wasn't a cop officially. \"Gary\" used elaborate disguises and could somehow tap into the head of the person who was trying to order a hit. Getting many people arrested and saving a lot of lives.But a woman named \"Madison,\" played by Adria Arjona, who was looking for \"Gary's\" services, threw a monkey wrench into the op. Now being clouded by beauty and getting lost in disguise. \"Gary\" is going to be forced to make a lot of difficult decisions and be tempted to lead a stray. In this surprisingly based on a true story film.\"Hit Man\" was another home run by Glen Powell. Who was also a producer, helped create the story, and was involved with this film from top to bottom. This was his baby, and he did a great job with it.The acting was great, and the story was so intriguing. A lot of films I've watched recently have been so entertaining, partly because they are derived from true events. It just makes things better when you think about how this happened.Unfortunately, the real Gary Johnson passed away. He was an intriguing man who had a true calling, I can't lie. Some stuff was dramatized, but a lot was real. It's fascinating. He should be cheered for all the lives he saved.Glen Powell is on a heater, and he has another potential smash coming our way next month in \"Twisters.\" Let's see if he can keep shooting at this clip. Anyway, this was a fun film that was entertaining and frustrated you at times. But all in a good way. I give this film five mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin\n#CosmoMovieBlog\n#CosmoLanier\n#HitMan.",

        "description": "I totally I wasn't drawn to this movie, but devoid of anything else to watch on Netflix I gave it a punt. So glad I did. The actors all did a fantastic job, the script was sharp, well written and didn't distract from the plot. There was a lot of spark between the characters, backed up by no over-padding back stories, they just laid it out there and enjoyed the ride. I wouldn't go so far as to call it an out and out comedy, but it was humourous in an intelligent way. There was a certain amount of predictability but I also caught myself being denied some leading assumptions. If I were to be critical in any way it would be that the pacing at the beginning was a little laboured, we really didn't need to see all those perps being stung and the personalities of the main character, but I understand why the writer felt the need to embed his chameleon-like persona. I do think it could have gotten away with being a bit darker, and the ending was a bit too sugar-coated for me - more akin to a rom-con, and it could have again, gotten away with being more of a thriller/noir type movie, with a bit more of a twist at the end. But overall, very watchable and entertaining, a breath of fresh air in the (English) Netflix catalogue.",

        "description": "Well, I'll admit I wasn't a fan of either Glen Powell or Adria Arjona up until right now. Richard Linklater, one of the most captivating writer-directors of our times, is the guy behind that (sudden) change of perspective. He brings them together in such a fun, quirky little rom-com that takes advantage of their sizzling chemsitry. Like, wow. I didn't think Powell could actually take on a role with not one, but two personas embedded within. Arjona is too darn hot, and I like her even more when she moves as good as she speaks. And then, there are the signature Linklater dialogues on life's little pleasures, and random stuff like the cosmos, fish, signing contracts, pies, slicing fingertips, and whatnot. Gosh, not many can treat ARTICULATION like the sexy skill it is.. King Richard Linklater and his intriguing philosophies, I'm forever SOLD!The humor in the film is candid, subtle, and situational. There are some great puns and parallels drawn, with dialogues doing a lot of the work. What stops me from rating this any higher is the rather convenient ending (which I kinda foresaw) and it lacked the element of surprise that the rest of the film was nearly able to pull off. But for what it's worth, this once again proves that two actors who are better known for their physical appearance, can in the hands of a great director, impress you with their performances. The foreplay/sex scenes in the film are magnificently executed, and you'll almost feel the HEAT occupying the entire room. To think this was the exact opposite I felt when I saw Glen Powell & Sydney Sweeney together in Anyone But You.. speaks volumes!P. S. Full marks for the Patrick Bateman reference.",

        "description": "Hold onto your hats, folks, because \"Hit Man\" (2023) is the rollicking, riotous ride we didn't know we needed! Glen Powell takes the lead as the most lovable fake hitman this side of the silver screen, delivering one-liners and dodging bullets with a roguish wink that's bound to steal hearts and illicit chuckles. His partner in crime, Adria Arjona, holds her own with snark and sass, making this dynamic duo an absolute delight to watch. Their back-and-forth banter crackles with such electric chemistry, you'd think they were trying to out-charm each other in every scene.Plot-wise, imagine a blender filled with action, comedy, and a sprinkle of absurdity-and then imagine it explodes. That's this movie. It's a wild mash-up of genres that dances dangerously close to the edge of ridiculousness without ever tumbling over. Each plot twist is more surprising than the last, serving up a deliciously unpredictable narrative that keeps you guessing whether you're still watching a comedy or if you've stumbled into a thriller by mistake. The action sequences? Think ballet with bullets. It's so over-the-top that you can't help but applaud the audacity.So, why does this cinematic carnival ride earn a solid 4.5 stars? Well, it's simple: it's damn entertaining. Sure, it flirts with chaos, and maybe one too many jokes doesn't land perfectly, but who cares when you're having this much fun? \"Hit Arnold\" is a film that doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you. Pop some popcorn, suspend your disbelief, and prepare to be thoroughly amused. Just when you think you've seen it all, \"Hit Man\" winks and says, \"Hold my beer.\"",

At around the one-quarter mark, the depth of the acting and the philosophical undertones provide an exhilarating high.Glen Powell is a true chameleon, showcasing his craft in the finest manner.

Oh dear, for about the first half hour I wondered if it was really going to be this silly and dull. Then it changed I couldn't believe it, looked like a rom-com but then it changes again and it seems to stop, as I did I wondered how it was going to happen and my wife thought something else. Either of our ideas would have been better and it really does turn into unfunny romance. Only the other day I picked up a £1 DVD in a charity shop I'd never heard of it, Beautiful Creatures (2000) and it really was like a noir and it was very funny and it had an early one of Rachel Weisz which was wonderful. Those killers were really scary but in the Hit-Man they certainly were not but surely they were supposed to, or maybe not.",

        "description": "If you enjoy quirky movies, director Richard Linklater is your guy. His latest is HIT MAN, which is a romantic comedy that's very loosely based on an article about a real guy, Gary Johnson. Gary (Glen Powell) is a college professor and part-time staffer at the New Orleans Police Department. He stumbles into a new role as an undercover hitman, arresting people who try hiring him to kill someone. It turns out he's very good at it. Powell really showcases his talents here, playing different characters for each arrest. When he meets Madison (Adria Arjona) though, he breaks protocol. I guess Powell has great chemistry with whoever he works with. He has an undeniable charm that seems like it spreads to the whole cast. I could tell they had fun filming this. It also has a very smart script, playing with ideas of identity and being your true self. The strong sense of humour actually changes as the movie progresses, which was fun for me, but might not work for some. I find it hilarious that they must've asked the real Gary Johnson for permission to go as far as they do here. The movie makes it clear what actually happened during the end credits. HIT MAN is quirky, unconventional, and very enjoyable. If you can't see it in theaters, don't worry! It'll be on Netflix June 7th. Make sure the algorithm doesn't bury it. Enjoy!",

        "date": "7 October 2023",
        "description": "Hitman is definitely a film-lover's paradise but even the casual film viewer will thoroughly enjoy this brilliant new movie. Linklater's latest lovingly pays homage to film noir, screwball comedy, Hitchcockian black comedy and even the good old psychosexual drama but it still somehow manages to conjure up a fresh, witty and often uproarious confection that frequently teases, delights and occasionally thrills the audience with frissons of excitement, keeping them enraptured all the way to its deliciously razor sharp ending.This is potentially a star-making turn for Glen Powell. Although he made a strong impression in Top Gun: Maverick as a cocky rival pilot, his role in Hit Man is easily more complex and, as the co-writer of the script, he has been able to add brilliant layers to his character, or should that be characters? In effect, Powell is playing more than one character - Gary Johnson, mild-mannered, cat-loving geeky Psychology professor and audio techie who moonlights as a surveillance expert for a Louisana-based police unit that targets and stings hapless ne'er-do-wells who are looking to hire a killer. Before the next sting operation, Gary's police colleague Jasper (Austin Amelio) who normally pretends to be the hired killer is suspended for brutally attacking two youths, which forces Gary's colleagues (brilliantly played by Retta and Sanjay Rao) into convincing Gary to take over from the universally loathed Jasper, much to Gary's dismay. Yet, within minutes of taking on the task, Gary suddenly morphs into \"Ron\" and during his first sting he is so convincing that his colleagues are shocked, even though they had believed he could do it having heard Jasper go through the rigamarole on previous occasions. It is a brilliant piece of acting.Having created the killer persona, Gary soon finds himself becoming more and more immersed in Ron, adding further, chameleon-like layers of disguise and character traits to mirror whoever is about to be stung. However, things become really complicated (in true film noir style) when \"Ron\" is approached by a femme fatale, Maddy (beautifully played by Adria Ajrona who also adds a delightfully a kooky sexy edge as well as a tender vulnerability). As the sparks between the two begin to fly during a hilarious but flirty exchange, Gary, who is clearly enjoying himself as Ron, finds himself conflicted. Dare he. As Ron, continue with the sting and have Maddy arrested for plotting to murder her husband? Has the flirtatious exchange caused Maddy to betray some regrets about what she is doing? The chemistry between Powell and Arjona is a pleasure to witness. Both actors bring out the best in one another and it is thrilling.Off-beat is an expression that would certainly apply to Hit Man - and it is a compliment. It is also one of the most enjoyable and fun 2 hours I've had in the cinema in the past few years. I absolutely adore this film.",

Gary was a great character until Powell and Linkletter decided he was a sociopath.He stays with a woman who cavalierly announce she killed her husband. That doesn't scare Gary away ..no he's in love and has cats So to even out Gary commits his own murder. And right then next to a dying man that they had just drugged and murder they have sex!That people find this funny is beyond me. Not sure I am comfortable with people who do.

It would've been nice to see them have at least one \"get to know you\" interaction outside of the sex-murder dichotomy.The ending is also.... Unnecessary.

There is no doubt that Hit Man is a fun, maybe even entertaining, film at times. Seeing the magnificent Glenn Powell navigate the different personas he create for himself with considerable ease and suaveness is a great joy. But while this undercover average Joe turned hit-man idea may serve as an interesting premise, the film does not develop much from this premise meaningfully. The plot is overly slight, and the direction it goes is bizarre, especially the ending, which felt rushed and contrived. The plot does not develop in a manner which extracts full potential of comedy from its situation, and neither is it particularly entertaining. Also, Despite what some critics have praised, I could not see much chemistry between Arjona and Powell. Sure, they are both more than serviceable in their roles, and they share several steamy scenes, but there is no special spark or unique connection between the two. At the end of the day, I find Hit Man very similar to The Fall Guy, a movie released at around the same time. Both are serviceable, fun, and entertaining distractions which can barely hold and audiences attention for two hours. But both are overly light on actual plot, are only mildly entertaining, and not as funny or enjoyable as they should have been.",

        "description": "My first experience with Glenn Powell was his supporting role in Top Gun: Maverick. He's been around much longer but he was good at playing the brash and cocky Hangman. He's been noteworthy in previous efforts (Hidden Figures was also mentioned by one of my friends) but I was blown away by his work in Hit Man, not only is he fantastic as the suave and smooth Ron but he's also convincing as the reserved and stale Gary (I do have some thoughts on how they present Gary, more on that later). But watching him in Hit Man, it felt like I was watching someone doing acting gymnastics, he's playing so many different and bizarre characters and he nailed every single one. He also has great chemistry with his co-star Adria Arjona, I was just as interested in the their torrid romance than I was in what costume Gary was going to shuffle into next. Speaking of Adria, her work in this was also noteworthy, it would have been easy to make assumptions about Madison's character if Adria's performance didn't make her so mysterious and alluring. She's beautiful, she got her fair share of laughs from me and I was surprised at how invested I was in Gary and Madison's relationship by the end of the movie. I also wanted to credit Austin Amelio, Retta and Sanjay Rao for their collective work in their supporting parts. Another expectation the movie subverts is painting Jasper as a two dimensional villain, Austin makes Jasper unlikeable but not inhuman or not believable as Gary's dejected co-worker.Besides the performances, my favourite part of Hit Man was how it subverts the formula. I can't call it wholly and completely original but I was constantly trying to guess the next twist or shift in the narrative based on similar films. Hit Man continued to zag when I expected it to zig and it's so well layered. Director Richard Linklater and his team have a sense of when they need to switch things up, just when the movie gets too goofy, we get more time with Ron & Madison bonding or when you're about to guess when a twist will happen, the movie will suddenly get much darker. There's several tones at play but they are mixed together so precisely that it kept me entertained when I feel like another movie would have lost me.So many movies are \"based\" on a true story and sure enough, Hit Man isn't the unvarnished truth up on the screen. But the movie is cognizant of the fatigue that comes with this claim and admits it upfront. It helps that the true story is so fantastical that I wasn't bothered in how they tweaked it. Despite the changes, Hit Man is so good natured and seems to being celebrating Gary's unbelievable skill set that I didn't get bogged down in what was true and what wasn't.Hit Man slowly builds toward the finale and despite climax being morally murkier and darker tinged than I maybe expected, I loved how the ending punctuated what was a hugely enjoyable film. I was rooting for Gary/Ron and Madison despite what was revealed about them and it's captured wonderfully by Linklater. The movie doesn't pause to scold you for being sympathetic to one party or another and I liked that it wasn't too concerned with the absolute morality of the characters. The film ends with a metaphorical wink to the audience and it felt like a chef's kiss on a delicious meal.I'm going to be brief about any griping, My only problem is that they don't do a wholly convincing job of dressing Glen Powell down to be the nerdy and shy Gary Johnson when he's just being himself. It's reminiscent of sitcoms slapping glasses on models to trying to present them as dowdy. When everyone is making jokes about how \"normal\" and \"unassuming\" Gary looks, I rolled my eyes a little. But I guess Glen Powell being too handsome to be terribly convincing as a geek college professor is a nice problem to have.Hit Man was such a pleasant surprise, I felt like I was taking a gamble taking friends to see it in the theatre with me but we all walked out impressed. It made me a little sad that it was simultaneously released on Netflix, this is a theatre quality movie and while I understand it might have had a tougher road to profitability than your typical summer tentpole, it earned my ticket price. The film is so much fun, Glen Powell and Adria Arjona light up the screen and the fact that it's based on a true story is just delightful (I loved the end credits joke on how they changed the story). I tip my hat to Powell, Linklater & his team and the real Gary Johnson, I had a great time with Hit Man. I'd rate this at an 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9/10 and while you should check it out on Netflix, you won't regret going to see it in theatres either.",

        "description": "Richard Linklater's (Before Sunrise trilogy, Boyhood) latest film is getting very good reviews so it's quite a surprise once you see it that it's average at best. One of the reasons for that is the lack of variety and emotion Glen Powell puts in (or doesn't) in his performance. There should be a duality between his build-up cocky Ron hit man persona and Gary, his softer, nerdier, normal day-to-day self. Yet, when he supposedly switches between one and the other there's no real substantial difference between the two besides a cosmetic one. One would think this would be the role to show his acting prowess but there seems to be very little and this is nowhere near Bryan Cranston's duality performance skills as Walter White in Breaking Bad if we were to compare an actors task of switching between two sides of a character.There's never any palpable tension in Gary/Ron, he's always in control. He's in control when he becomes the face of the supposed hit-man for the first time (no nervousness, nothing), he is in control when everything starts to unravel, he's in control when he's being confronted with his actions during the climax of the film, and so on - and the film suffers very much from it as we never go along with the main character or actually worry about him, as the main actor never really does anything with it.Likewise, it's a bit boring at times, the cinematography is beyond plain and it's very predictable. The film would have been so much better had it been more stylised, with a more substantial visual flair and a cool soundtrack at least to cover its flaws, since overall there's not really much meat to the story and the film ends up being about nothing.",

Based on a true story, the film features commendable performances, particularly from Glen Powell, but suffers from a lack of character development and emotional depth.Glen Powell delivers a standout performance, embodying his character with a mix of charm and authenticity that makes him a compelling figure to watch. His nuanced portrayal brings a layer of believability to the narrative, making the moments of action and subtle humor particularly enjoyable. Powell's ability to infuse his role with both intensity and a touch of levity is one of the film's highlights.The movie does offer a few humorous moments that provide a welcome break from the otherwise serious tone. These lighter scenes are well-executed and add a layer of entertainment, making the film a decent choice for those looking for a casual watch. However, the humor alone is not enough to compensate for the film's more significant shortcomings.One of the primary issues with \"Hitman\" is its lack of character development. Despite the film being based on a true story, the characters feel underdeveloped and one-dimensional. There is a noticeable absence of emotional depth, which makes it difficult for the audience to connect with or care about the characters on a deeper level. This lack of character growth and exploration is a missed opportunity that could have elevated the film from being merely good to something truly impactful.Richard Linklater's direction, while competent, fails to fully capitalize on the story's potential. The narrative feels rushed at times, and the pacing issues detract from the overall impact of the film. There are moments that hint at deeper emotional and psychological layers, but these are never fully explored, leaving the audience with a sense of incompleteness.In conclusion, \"Hitman\" is a film that is good for passing the time but doesn't leave a lasting impression. Glen Powell's strong performance and the film's occasional humor make it worth a watch, but the lack of character development and emotional depth prevent it from being anything more than a mildly entertaining diversion. With a more nuanced approach to storytelling and character development, \"Hitman\" could have been much more impactful.",

'Hit Man' somehow achieves the opposite - it's a fluffy confection inspired by the real-life exploits of a psychology professor who masquerades a professional hit man while moonlighting for the police department. Gary Johnson carries out this pretense in order to entrap those looking to hire an assassin.The film's introductory sequences show restaurant encounters where he convinces several would-be murderers he's a hardened criminal in the liquidation business. These meetings are recorded, and the conspirators arrested after clearly stating their intent and handing over a down-payment. Linklater's narrative departs from reality when a beautiful Latina asks him to terminate her abusive husband. To the confusion of his handlers, Gary refuses her payment, and suggests she initiate divorce proceedings instead of contracting a homicide. Needless to say, complications ensue when he secretly starts an affair with her while maintaining his killer-for-hire persona.'Hit Man' could have followed in the footsteps of modern classics like 'Body Heat', but Linklater chooses to play it for light comedy rather than drama. Tension is lost as the proceedings become increasingly frivolous and unlikely. The acting performances and amusing screenplay just about hold one's interest, but the end-result feels like an insubstantial appetizer that could have been a memorable main course with a different approach.",

The movie has witty comedy, steamy romance, and an all around engaging atmosphere to keep you more than satisfied throughout its runtime. Fans of Richard Linklater's work can sleep well knowing there's yet another gem in his latest offering.",

        "description": "Glen Powell is the most boring guy in the world. He teaches philosophy in New Orleans and helps out a unit of the police who puts people who try to hire hit men into prison. Then Austin Amelio, the cop who usually talks to the would-be clients to get them to say they want someone dead and give him money is pulled from active service. He's a dirty cop. Apparently there's nothing wrong with that in the Big Easy, but the video went viral.So Powell steps in. He discovers a real talent for playing a fake hit man, and the conviction rate goes way up. Then, Adria Arjona wants her husband dead, but won't come out and say it. Powell tells her to take the money she was going to give him and leave. Later, they meet up and start an affair, but she thinks it's with a hit man. Then her husband dies in an alley.Richard Linklater's movie is not just a good black comedy. It's also a statement about the current belief that you can change who you are by changing what you do. Intellectually it's a bit of a straw man argument in this movie, but it's a story, not a balanced lecture. If it was good enough for George Bernard Shaw, it's good enough for Linklater.",

        "description": "The hitman is already for a long time a popular character in crime and (neo) noir films. For me the ultimate hitman-film is \"The day of the jackal\" (1973, Fred Zinnemann). In this film Edward Fox plays a hitman that is professional, emotionless and a typical loner.Only the last description does apply to Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) in \"The hit man\". He is however not a real hit man but an undercover hit man. He meets people looking for a hit man and makes sure the compromising evidence is on tape.In order to do this he changes outfit all the time and this leads to a comic costume parade, including an imitation of Anton Chigur (Javier Bardem), the hit man from \"No country for old men\" (2007, Ethan & Joel Coen).Being partly a comedy, \"Hit man\" is an odd one in the oeuvre of director Richard Linklater, who is mostly known for his \"Before .... \" relation trilogy (1995, 2004,2013) and his coming of age film \"Boyhood\" (2014).\"Hit man\" really takes of when Gary Johnson falls in love with one of his clients (Maddy Masters played by Adria Arjona). It is the starting point of a roller coaster of numerous unexpected twists and turns.One of the themes is losing sight of the difference between your undercover \"me\" and your real \"me\". It happens in numerous film, but it also happens in reality. In an investigation from 1994 - 1996 the Dutch parliament studied how it happened by the police while combatting organized crime.The fact is however that Gary Johnson has two real \"me's\", one as a part-time police officer and one as a professor in philosophy. The last one delivers the philosophical theme of the movie of how to find a satisfactory balance between ratio and discipline (represented by the Greek God Apollo) and feeling, emotions, instincts and living dangerously (represented by the Greek God Dionysus).Remarkable is that where his most famous films (The \"Before\" trilogy and \"Boyhood\") are typical for an Apollonian world, \"Hit man\" descends to the depths of Dionysus.By the way, \"Hitman\" is in my opinion not very flattering for women, showing how they prefer the sex appeal of a hit man to that of a \"dull\" police officer (let alone a nerdy professor).",

Here, he's a rather geeky teacher (Gary) who teaches philosophy at a college whilst occasionally helping out the cops with some criminal profiling. When one of their investigators \"Jasper\" (Austin Amelio) goes a bit too far and gets suspended, Gary gets drafted in last minute and proves quite effective at getting folks who want to bump of their nearest and dearest for $5,000 to admit their cunning plans to a well wired-up con. The more of these cases he does, the better he gets; the more fun he has dressing up and adept he becomes at assuming a range of identities. It's \"Maddy\" (Adria Arjona) who sets the cat amongst the pigeons when she asks him to get shot of her thuggish husband \"Ray\" (Evan Holtzman). He takes a shine to her and talks her out of her criminal ploy. Quickly the two are seeing each other - which is manna from heaven for the deposed \"Jasper\". When her husband is found dead, he thinks he knows exactly who did what and how best to exact his revenge... It's quite an entertaining romantic thriller this, providing Powell with an opportunity to charm his way through an almost two hours of cinema that is light and fluffy, completely preposterous yet based on a true character. Arjona looks like she is having a good time here, too - and the last twenty minutes are quite fun. No, it won't trouble a BAFTA jury I suspect - but it's quite enjoyable summertime fayre.",

However at some point he starts to moonlight for the police first as tech support, then due to some circumstances as a fake hit man. That second act of the movie is good and entertaining in showing how he does what he does. Then enter Maddy Masters with a serious domestic issue at her hands, The sparks between them are there, they start a romance. Everything ok, until here still a mildly entertaining movie.The problem however is the third act. It's difficult to describe the issue without spoilers so here they come:\nMaddy's husband is dead. It turns out she has killed him. As the investigation shows, a recent life insurance policy could be motive. Gary is sent in to get a confession from Maddy. Instead that he is actively guiding her by providing her with clues how to appear innocent in the exchange.A bit problematic, but hey, this is not a documentary, it's fiction.But of course one of the cops figured out, that it was Maddy who killed her husband and now tries to blackmail her for some of the insurance money. Her solution to the problem: spiking his bottled beer (how?) so he gets unconscious while blackmailing Maddy and Gary. Gary's solution, as drugging a cop does not have the best looks: Killing the cop, obviously.And then, they live happily ever after.So we summarize: Maddy kills her husband probably for the insurance money, Gary covers it up by murdering a cop. Followed by a happy end. Shall this really be the moral of the story? I have my difficulties with that.",

While I don't exactly find it really good and just find at a good rom-com flick, Hit Man offers a more respectable approach that is a nice change of pace of various \"Based on a true story\" movies. Instead of trying to make it seem like all the events in the movie happened in real life in a deceiving manner, Hit Man, based on a real person, openly states the inaccuracies in the movie that are much different from real life events. I find various movies these days don't offer this type of respect to real people or events and the idea of adding fantasy elements and blending them with reality results in some people believing it entirely. This results in a different view towards certain real people and events, which is all just very manipulative and upsetting. While this isn't really that big of an issue (except when it's done a problematic way, such as disrespecting loss of life, tragedy, etc.) but I really do appreciate Hit Man's honesty about it. I absolutely recommend Hit Man as a fun watch and I do love how respectful it is to the real people it's based around.",

The film raises some interesting existential questions, literally. And it's attempts to elevate the material from standard 'rom-com' should be commended, but unfortunately the execution of that ends up being it's undoing.The Bad: This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. First, the pacing. The first hour or so is slow and monotonous. With scenes being repeated as if the film is trying to prove a point, but doesn't actually add anything to the overall character / narrative. Secondly, the film tries too hard to fit in a bunch of different genres and tropes. Is it a rom-com? Sometimes. Is it a dark comedy? I guess. Is it a movie which asks existential questions whilst exploring that theme with the characters? It tries to. Unfortunately it all just mixes into a big pile of bleh. When it could have been so much more if it cut some of the bloat and redundant scenes. Disappointing.Summary: It's not bad and the last half is actually pretty decent. But if you're looking for a classic rom-com with some caper style shenanigns (curse you trailer) - you're not going to find it here. If you're not looking for that, go for it.",

Sometimes, his light touch does take away the tension. This movie should be spiraling in intensity as he gets trapped by his secret relationship.

It's the kind of story that, much like Edgar Wright's Baby Driver or Shaun of the Dead, would've made for a mediocre movie if directed by an amateur, but made for a great movie because it was directed by an experienced industry professional. All Linklater films are good films.This film keeps you guessing from beginning to end and tells its story in a way that makes the audience feel like they are learning and growing along with the characters. A great example of this is when the film periodically cuts back to Glen Powell's character, Gary Johnson, lecturing students on the everyday behaviors of people. Gary casually and subtly uses his experience as an undercover investigator as the building blocks for these lessons. By doing this, Gary is also introducing and breaking down the overarching themes of the film. It truly is brilliant storytelling.There will never be enough words to properly commend the actors in this film. They brought so much life and enthusiasm to their characters in constant battle between show stealers. In this battle, there were no winners or losers. The acting was balanced and cast members complimented their costars exquisitely.Linklater and Powell's writing was entertaining, truly comedic, well paced, and extremely thoughtful. It is definitely a must see for film buffs searching for depth and those just looking for a fun surface-level comedy. It does both properly in all respects.",

        "description": "Hit Man is a new action comedy directed, written and produced in part by Richard Linklater, director of Boyhood and Before Midnight.Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) is a school teacher, but also secretly works for the police. At one point he has to play a fake hitman with the police. He is hired by clients to commit murders, but after clients confess their criminal plans to Gary, the police can arrest them.When Madison Masters (Adria Arjona) wants to hire Gary, he falls for her beauty. This causes him to break his own rules and try to change Madison's mind so that she does not carry out criminal plans. The two fall in love, but Madison actually falls for the hitman Ron, who played Gary for her. On the other hand, Gary shouldn't show that he's broken his own code to Madison because it could get him in trouble with the police and ruin his career.This film is based on a true story, where the real Gary Johnson posed himself to the police as a hitman who criminals could hire to commit murders. Only after sharing their murderous plans with Gary could the police catch them. The real Gary Johnson had to dress up so many times, wearing different styles of clothes and wigs to appear different to each criminal, so he couldn't be exposed as an undercover cop. Glen Powell also does the same at the beginning of the film. He wears different costumes and also acts in different ways. For example, the film starts off more like an action comedy, but when Gary falls for Madison, the film turns more into a romantic comedy.Richard Linklater provides a comic action film, but with repeated events, where Gary, in different disguises, makes various criminals confess. When the film later turns more into a romantic comedy, this mainly works because of the good chemistry between Glen Powell and Adria Arjona, their characters. Glen Powell only plays a character who leads a double life and his character ends up in a relationship with the possible criminal. This creates complicated situations in which he has to continue working strategically, without Madison or the police realizing that he is actually lying to both of them. However, the film does have a somewhat abrupt ending, which does not seem to answer everything.Glen Powell plays the lead role well and actually has to play the role in different ways. This gives him the opportunity to show different acting capabilities in this film. Adria Arjona also plays the role of a seductive, possible criminal well, because as a viewer, like the main characters, you do not always know whether she can be completely trusted. After his time in various Walking Dead series, Austin Amelio also gets the chance to act in a film. He plays a colleague of the main character, who may thwart his strategic plans if he is told too much.",

Not only were the ideas interesting but so was the manner in which they were delivered.

Glen Powell gives a pretty good performance of acting dorky and kinda introverted, yet it feels like most of that is because his glasses are doing most of the acting for him. He's able to play a fun variety of hit men, but that isn't really the central focus. Adria Arjona is pretty good at the love interest with what could best be described as innocently dark intentions.The jokes from many of the side characters didn't really work for me, most notably Gary's two police associates, played by Retta and Sanjay Rao. There seemed to be some kind of underlying message about how we're all capable of change in one way or another, but I feel like that was included to justify the surprisingly dark yet underwhelming ending this movie pulls.Overall, there's not much to say about Hit Man, aside from being an occasionally darkly humorous and empty movie that you'd put on when you don't want to think too hard.",

I can't fault the performances, and it is a fun enjoyable watch, which is worth viewing at home. I did get a bit of an insight into a whole 'world' of detective work that is legal and I was shocked by how scarily common it is for a spouse, or disgruntled friend/relation/colleague/rival to attempt to set up a hitman to kill.Having since read a bit about the guy upon whom this film's main character is based, his 'success' is undeniable. The parallel lives he led is impressive and fascinating. The statistics we are given on screen are accurate. But, it does become rather a farfetched plot and in some cases of 'based on true events' films I've really felt 'truth can be stranger/more wild than fiction '.However, in the case of Hitman, the twists and turns the story takes are fictional, and discovering this was slightly disappointing but I guess it also makes me feel they did a good job at using a true character and expanding/fleshing out an entertaining yarn!I'd love to see a documentary on this guy, and/or a different director/filmmakers create a more serious, exploration of him or other people who work undercover, and the impact this has upon their psyche, relationships, and the type of person who can actually live a life like this.",

Gary, wearing multiple disguises for his wildly different clients, can further enhance his lectures on the self: \"What if your self is a construct?\" he asks his students.Gary remains an operative who never kills anyone until he meets comely client, Maddy (Adria Arjona), and is drawn into a caper as Ron and lover, possibly becoming at least an accomplice to murder. Meanwhile, director Richard Linklater, who knows a thing or two about actors as lovers, weaves the romance with college lectures on identity and psychological self-styling, common threads in our social-media landscape. Our ability to create our own persona on Facebook or Snapchat, for example, is not unlike his profession, but not quite as dangerous, mostly.You don't need to know Nietzsche to believe that a mild-mannered professor could play a hit man (a student exclaims, \"When did our teacher get hot?\") or that anyone could construct a personality with the help of the Internet. The film becomes more than an amusing thriller as identities play a key role in furthering a promising romance or solving a crime that has murder as a centerpiece.Although more than once it's claimed there are no hitmen now or in history, Hit Man goes a long way in convincing us that they could be real. In more than one extended dialogue, Gary/Ron explains the complexity and allure of switching identities.Hit Man has its own double identity-cool summer caper and dangerous romance, both threatened by electronic surveillance and the human capability of shifting its persona throughout life. Although the subject of identity crafting involving the id, the ego, and the superego can't be adequately discussed in a brief TV melodrama, Hit Man does give one pause. And a brisk summer breeze.",

In any event, it's a fun movie and the acting is superb, and I Hope It is a Big hit on Netflix. Because it should be.",

It's like Fletch meets Confessions of a Dangerous Mind with a bit of The Nice Guys and, of course, Linklater's trademark philosophical schtick added. Make no mistake, this isn't trying to be Chinatown - it's most certainly a comedy, in line with the aforementioned movies. There's a lot to like here!Glen Powell is a funny and charming guy who's rising quickly - he's got that Ryan Reynolds, Gosling thing. A touch of Sam Rockwell, too. This is a great role for him!Aaand now the negative - it wrapped up too neatly. I, unfortunately, didn't entirely buy the love story. While intriguing (there was some chemistry!), it was too cut and dry. I'm surprised Linklater went in this direction, frankly, and not sure what to say about it. I guess he had his fun with this zany story and gave us a happy ending, but it felt disingenuous. Didn't ruin it for me, just surprised by the Hollywood ending 🤷‍♂️Overall, I can't deny that it's a step in the right direction for what people want to see. This is entertainment. It delivered. It's funny, sexy and mysterious with good looking people! It's ok to want that - it's what Hollywood was built on. It's been a while since I've enjoyed a newer movie like this, so I'm pretty happy with my 2 hr experience. Flaws and all, it's just fun!",

How was this good guy going to get out of the mess he'd inadvertently created? I wanted to see.But it seems the writers found the situation too difficult to get out of themselves, so in the last few minutes, they cut away from that moral arc and opt instead for an absolutely perverse Hollywood ending: the \"good\" guys choose to transform themselves into \"evil\" guys and then live as \"pretend-to-be-good\" guys in a happily-ever-after Hallmark moment. What?!! Are we supposed to feel good that they got away with murdering two people, neither of them in self-defense, because they are now empowered and sexy? Some excuses were made about how some people \"deserve to be killed\"; apparently this means anyone who is in your way or that you find annoying! This comes from a character who teaches philosophy, his philosophy finally being: be whomever you want to be, just don't be boring. (Being evil is okay, because that's \"hot\"!)I can't say this message is unique in Hollywood these days, the only difference being that this movie is a wolf in sheep's clothing, posing as a rom-com that is actually a tragic farce.Don't bring your children to watch this, unless your goal is to raise sexy little murderers.",

Powell is paired perfectly with Adria Arjona, who is a newcomer to me, and oh boy, she is a delight on the screen. From the moment she appears, you are rooting for her.

As it is, he passed away in 2022 before \"Hit Man\" started filming, but it's known that the love interest part of the film was entirely fictional, so at least he didn't die a murderer.This was an entertaining flick up to a point, but it got truly weird when Gary (Glen Powell) arrived at Madison Masters' apartment and coached her through a string of lies while his police department associates listening in tried to catch her admitting that she killed her husband. She had already done so with Gary, which caused him to freak out and give up his fake identity as 'Ron' the hitman. Quite honestly, I can't imagine how the guy was able to make with a comeback for every prospective client who was looking to have someone eliminated. The guy never said the wrong thing and had an answer for every eventuality. Talk about thinking on one's feet!So even though this picture might have been based on a true story, the whole thing had an air of incredulity about it. Getting back to the real Gary Johnson, he assisted in the arrests of more than 70 people seeking contract killers using aliases when it suited his purpose. The Madison Masters character was based on a woman that Johnson referred to social services and a therapist to get the help she needed to end an abusive relationship. When all was said and done, Gary Johnson never did kill anyone as a supposed contract killer, nor did Glen Powell's character, who probably would have missed if he had to pull the trigger.",

It is of a fake contract hitman who is assigned as a spoof character by the cops to lure victims of paying contracts out to clients.Except the people paying out become the victims. So one day he falls for a dark-haired woman called Madison Figueroa Masters; played by Adria Arjona and he tells her not to pull on the hit and take the money and run.This is when it all changes his life and her life. It's quite an obvious script from her as the actor acting as the hitman becomes more like the styled hitman he pretends to be; because he has fallen for this girl and is seducing her.She is in lust with his protective character and natural charm; chilvary and etiquitte. Something which her arsehole husband clearly lacks.There are a few twists and turns which you can probably figure out along the way. It's an unrealistic story and it's not a convincing police operation. It is acted very well and the cinema is descent enough but it just is a rushed film and why is it two hours long? It really doesn't need to be. Anyther disappointing straight-to-netflix release.The lead protagonist; Glen Powell does a very good job of blending Ryan Gosling with Garry Oldman. Glen is a superb actor. A shame that the script was just too silly and romanticised. 6/10. Production is excellent. Acting strong.",

However, the chemistry between him and the female lead is lacking, and their sensual scenes feel forced and unnatural. The female lead's exaggerated attempts to be alluring through her facial expressions were particularly distracting.Despite these issues, the movie is fun and entertaining. Glen Powell's fans will especially enjoy his charm and energy. The film's upbeat nature makes it a good choice for a casual movie night. However, the disparity in acting abilities among the cast is noticeable and somewhat diminishes the film's potential. If all the actors had matched Powell's level of performance, the movie could have been much better.In conclusion, while I'm not a huge fan of Glen Powell, I can appreciate his strong performance in this film. I hope future projects feature a more balanced ensemble cast to complement his talents. Thanks for reading my review, and I hope you all enjoy the movie despite its flaws!",

        "description": "Believe the hype: Richard Linklater and Glen Powell's Hit Man is awesome! It's a slick, sexy screwball comedy about identity that only a filmmaker like Richard Linklater could properly pull off! I'd say this might even be the must see romantic dark comedy of the decade! Hit Man is definitely a film-lover's paradise but even the casual film viewer will thoroughly enjoy this brilliant new movie. Linklater's latest lovingly pays homage to film noir, screwball comedy, Hitchcockian black comedy and even the good old psychosexual drama but it still somehow manages to conjure up a fresh, witty, and often uproarious confection that frequently teases, delights, and occasionally thrills the audience with frissons of excitement, keeping them enraptured all the way to its deliciously razor sharp ending. Go in blind - it's such a fun movie to experience with a crowd, knowing nothing of what's to come! I absolutely loved my experience watching this movie - it's a shame most people will experience it on Netflix for the first time. But because this movie is so unique and fun to experience knowing nothing about it - I'm gonna keep this short in order to preserve the experience of watching it for the first time! This film has been hyped up for months and yet it was still able to surpass everything I expected of it. This was some fresh, fun, effortless storytelling that works so well, and truly allows Glen Powell to ascend to a new level of movie stardom with such a charismatic performance! This is potentially a star-making turn for Glen Powell. Although he made a strong impression in Top Gun: Maverick as a cocky rival pilot, his role in Hit Man is easily more complex and, as the co-writer of the script, he has been able to add brilliant layers to his character, or should that be characters? His chemistry with the equally terrific Adria Arjona was dynamite, they both had true movie star energy! Both actors bring out the best in one another and it is thrilling! Hit Man is one of the most entertaining films of the year - a slick, cool, and hilarious crime film that deconstructs our notion of what a hitman is while simultaneously examining its lead character's ID, EGO, and SUPEREGO. This is Linklater at his most fun and effortless. A masterclass on direction, writing, and acting, Hit Man is a wild, entertaining ride that I can't wait to see many more times! I LOVED Hit Man, it left me with the biggest smile! It's a - hit, man!",

A philosophy professor moonlighting with a side gig assisting the NOLA Police Department who suddenly falls into the role of a lifetime when he fills in as a hit man for hire insn ongoing sting operation to thwart murder for hire plots. Much to everybody's surprise (himself included), it turns out he's really good at it.Along the way, he falls for a woman who initially comes to him to order a hit on her husband. Their chemistry unavoidable, he talks her out of it, they fall in love and then , in a sudden dark turn, she kills her husband. Yeah, she kills her husband.Rather than a moment of profound tonal shift into Coen Brotheresque neo-noir territory, the story continues apace along the same breezy pace before this shoulda been shocking event. There's no great reckoning. None. This would be weird for any character but for a philosophy professor with a deep regard for the moral clarity and ethics he espouses to his students in class all semester, it's particularly odd. Instead he lets it slide, comes clean with his love interest that he's really not a true hit man and in the process of participating in a murder to cover up the first murder effectively becomes the real thing.In more capable hands this could have been a classic slapdash 60s Cary Grant rom-com even with the unusual twist but it falls way short of anything especially comical or memorable. Like some of Linklater's other movies, there's a tonally flat quality that renders what should have been a really surprising transition little more than half baked and unnecessary. Whatever investment you've made in the characters feel like a waste.",

One day though, looking to set up a young woman eager to kill her brutal husband, he falls for her and convinces her to back away. A romance begins which gets more and more complicated as he continues to play at being Ron.Fun stuff, which starts off as a straight comedy as he traps all sorts of eccentrics who want to kill husbands and wives etc. However, when the romance starts each scene ramps up the complications with the story becoming increasing dark and seemingly impossible for Gary to escape prison, get the girl etc. Powell is really good - truly now looking like a big star presence - looking at identity and whether it is possible to embrace a new one if required, in turn requiring him to play lots of different characters in order to catch the baddies.

They are:1) The audience should like your protagonists\n2) Have a good ending\"Hit Man\" breaks both rules. It pains me to say that, because 75% of the film I mostly enjoyed. I thought the leads acted well, good chemistry, etc.The film wasn't that funny, if it was trying to be a black comedy, which I \"think\" it was? But as a romantic film it was okay enough. Unfortunately the ending just wasn't well conceived.I thought the final act, as the cops closed in on Madison being a killer, was well set up. But the film decided to give Gary, the male lead, not only a different personality at the end of it all, but a completely different moral compass as well.I looked forward to the final scene between the protagonists, Gary and Madison, and their showdown with a dirty cop.Up to this point, Gary was portrayed as a likable enough guy who seemed to want to do the right thing, even if he occasionally bent the rules it was for the right reasons. Until, well until......Gary mysteriously transforms at the end of the film into a cold blooded cop killer. Who kills his colleague, in a completely blatant act. Just 180 degree turn in character. Was the sex \"that\" good?But besides being an out of character move, the twist makes the protagonists into negative characters, right at the end, so this becomes the lasting impression of them.Weirdly, I think the director frames the actions as strangely just, because Madison's husband \"might've been a jerk\", but this was never shown on screen. The murdered cop was also talked about as being a bad guy but he was never depicted as a bad guy on screen.So because we have to take the word of the characters that these people deserved to die, and that makes it okay? Weird, weird ending.",

Glen acted great acting as multiple different individuals throughout his Hitman performances.",

        "description": "While the conceit of the dark rom-com sparked interest and the reviews were very positive, the actual experience of watching Hit Man began to drag about half-way through its nearly 2 hour runtime. My attention drifted and I began to browse reviews of the movie on my phone, trying to work out how I had been sold such a pup. The two leads are compelling attractive, but the quick-fire scenes used to build their on-screen romance felt tired and clichéd after the enjoyable run of scenes that preceded it, where we see Gary developing his hitman personas to suit his varied client base (with no shortage of intertextual references to other films with memorable killers).The movie picks up in the second half, culminating in one remorseless scene that brings together its themes and philosophy. It was enough to make up for the otherwise uncomfortable sense that the film was a slightly overlong apology for state-sanctioned murder and personal vigilante justice, disguised as a romantic comedy.I was left with the feeling that Hit Man could have been a much tighter, more engaging film if it was only about 25 minutes shorter.",

        "description": "Based on a monthly magazine article which itself was about a very real person, Gary Johnson. A psychology professor by profession, he also assists the New Orleans police department by going undercover. When another police who was tasked with going undercover as a fake hitman is suspended, Gary steps up to become Ron the hitman to catch the potential criminals who approach to hire him. What happens when Gary posing as Ron gets to meet a client and it's love at first sight? What trouble he gets into and how does he come out of the situation, forms rest of the story.Richard Linklater narrates this particular story which shifts gear when it comes to varied genres and it definitely helps to have a charming lead. Gary loves his job and is happy taking care of his pets so when he does get offered to go undercover, he gives his 100% to turn into a fake hit man and an ordinary professor turning into this charmer, is a transition well executed. The humor filled dialogues help ease out even when things seems to get serious. This is a genre that made me want some bigger twist in the final act but Richard chose to be loyal in narrating Gary's story or to say, not that predictable as I expected the story to be. Majority of the fun lies in those lines uttered not just by the lead actors and it's this smart balanced writing where the film wins big time.",

I know Powell is already a leading man but I think he is about to launch into superstardom. This role gave him the chance to show off some range and he was also more handsome and sexier in some of his personas than I have ever seen him before. Not just goody goody boy next store with an awful script (like a different recent Glen Powell movie I had the misfortune of watching) but confident, handsome man with some depth and surprises. And wit! And Arjona was just as talented and gorgeous. While the performances were excellent and thoroughly enjoyable (also from Austin Amelio), the script gave them all something substantive to work with. It's not Shakespeare but it is so much better than the usual crappy, predictable writing with uni-dimensional characters and over-the-top villains. It was witty, it had twists and turns (some of which one can see coming but a few of which surprised me). It was not as dark as I expected and maybe mixing neo-noir with rom-com would annoy some purists. But I just let it be what it is and appreciated seeing something that I have not already seen several times. I often multitask while watching movies but I didn't with this movie. It kept my attention and I didn't want to miss any of it--even facial expressions and, of course, the dynamics between the leads. I was sorry it ended and will definitely watch it again sometime.",

For the majority of the runtime this is an easygoing rom com but it gradually reveals a darker side without losing any of the charm of everything that preceded it. It's a really fun look at the many faces and personalities people can employ depending on the situation and if some people even have a true self.This feels like the final step in Glen Powell's road to becoming a fully fledged movie star. It's the ideal performance to showcase all of his leading man talents thanks to the many performances within the main performance, allowing him to remain thoroughly charming whilst skillfully blurring the lines between Gary and Ron as it goes along.Adria Ajorna is just as essential to this film working and gets an almost equally layered performance that deserves to make her a star as well. Her chemistry with Powell is electric from their very first encounter and she makes her character empathetic whilst adding a sense of mystery to her character as their relationship develops.Richard Linklater is on top form here with understated direction that plays to his strengths. He has a way of making his films feel so warm, trundling along nicely in a way that's patient yet engrossing with characters who are a pleasure to spend 2 hours with. Plus it still feels refreshing to see a mainstream film that isn't afraid to get hot and heavy.",

The overall screenplay would have been tighter with just the initial exposition, cutting the other classroom scenes, bringing the runtime to a crisp 90 minutes.Overall, this is a decent one-time watch that will soon be forgotten in the sea of Netflix flicks.On a side note, Adria Arjona is stunning!

Amazing directing and producing from all workers that put their time into this film...Richard Linklater, who co-wrote the screenplay with Powell and directed the film, probably did as well as expected with the money and talent he had to work with.

Definitely a novel plot where a quintessential University Professor Gary Johnson ( Glen Powell) who teaches psychology/ philosophy and whose hobby is tinkering with electronics lands up as an undercover agent with the local police department. He has the dubious job of trapping desparados who are ready to pay hitmen like him to eliminate people. He does well, the cops like him but his infatuation for a pretty female client creates problems for him and the police department. Things get messy when a murder takes place, an investigation is ordered and he is a suspect too.Director Richard Linklater had impressed me in \" Boyhood \" but this tale of intrigue and crime is totally a different ball game as far as narratives go. Nevertheless it is a riveting plot and the situations get murkier as the storyline unfolds. Glen Powell is at ease with the changing hues of the character he plays. (Interesting to note that he has collaborated as the writer with Linklater.) The movie could be termed as a dark thriller with the protagonist in a twin personality of the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde type. Adria Arjona as the love interest and Austin Amelio as the colleague have given strong support.",

I think they try to deliver the philosophy part or want to explain why or how characters develop in movies, which people already know. It just makes the story not go smoothly, it has Gary do his job and then come to have sex with Madison 3 times just to let us know that She has the knowledge to set up a murder from the after-sex talk. Rather than develop an antagonist story. So all we got from Jasper is a villain who lost his job because of himself and can't get back because of Gary. And U know what the final scene when Jasper is defeated they just add a sex scene for no reason. But overall it's pretty funny and that is the whole purpose. It would be better if they added music to the movie or had better background music that suits the scene the entire movie is so quite so we could have some memorable things but I guess this is what you're gonna get from a Netflix movie in the theater.",

She tries to be cute and silly but her performance just took me right out of the movie. For some reason, she makes the decision to use her bulging eyes as an Italian actor might use their hands. It's bizarre. Also, she is a murderer. So why would are leading man fall for a bug-eyed psychopath? The film doesn't explain this at all. Suddenly they're married with kids, and this ending is not happy. It feels tragic, as both of them have covered up murders.

But at the end he stood up with a projector and pitched us on joining his pyramid scheme. Thats what this movie feels like - its a hell of a ride but when you get to the end you cant help but feel like all the good was made to soften the blow of the terrible ending. At the end you start to realize it's really an hour and a half or so of great fun that's written to convince you to overlook the moral and emotional objections you're bound to have when the movie's over. But it doesn't work. The objections linger. And as much as I wish I wasn't, I was dissatisfied.Above all else Hit Man is entertaining. Glen Powell shows off a surprising range playing not only Gary, but all of Gary's made-up versions of himself. He's somehow able to covey believable emotion as different characters and still win us over as he navigates the morally ambiguous world of undercover sting operations. I was also very impressed by Adria Arjona who could solicit a hitman and still feel innocent and could be so seductive without it feeling camp. I have a feeling we'll be hearing her name everywhere soon enough. Overall the chemistry was undeniable and these core performances made the movie as enjoyable as it was.But the issue: Gary's problem, according to his ex wife in the beginning of the film, is that he wont change. And to her that's unfortunate because he's passionless and nerdy and stiff. So, throughout the movie as we watch him change into Ron we hear him teach his students about morality and the psychology of the self, which eventually leads him to the conclusion that moral absolutes don't exist and persistent personalities don't either - we can change who we are, we can change right and wrong, its all just contructs anyways. So, in the end he becomes a tough guy and a murderer. And we're supposed to be happy for him.If my girlfriend told me \"you need to change\" and I came back the next day as a psychopath she wouldnt thank me. She'd say \"thats not what I meant.\" Because any conversation about whether we can change is not just about change for change's sake. That was never the question. Gary's problem in the beginning of the film was that he needed personal growth and by the end he still didn't have it. He went from a nerdy guy who was antisocial in a not-talkative way to a cool guy who is antisocial in a clinical way.If they made it tongue in cheek that he'd become a murderer I could see it being passable because its edgy. We could say its satire. But they don't do that. It feels like they really believe that Gary did the right thing in the end. They don't treat him like the subject of a character study. They give him the happily ever after treatment like a hero. He kills his coworker so he can keep going steady with his secret friend with benefits, who also just confessed to murder. And then he says \"yeah that guy was kinda racist and misogynistic\" so we feel less bad about it. And then it cuts to him telling his students \"there are no absolutes.\" The absolute frustration I felt at the end of this movie got me thinking absolutes do exist.All in all I admit I enjoyed most of the movie. My advice is to watch it and then towards the end just pause it and make up an ending for yourself (thats just a social contruct, right? As Gary would say). Then you can have a great time and avoid the feeling someone is secretly trying to convince you to become a villain.P.",

As Gary moves up and plays the role of the Hitman, he puts many people behind bars until he comes across a struggling wife who wants her husband dead, after he talks to her things start to take a turn.If anything, the movie is worth watching to see the different Hitmen Glen Powell portrays, the Patrick Bateman is very funny.Overall the movie is light hearted, an action Rom-Com. Seeing Gary start to distance himself from himself and become Ron the hitman persona is a good journey.The acting is good, comedic timing is good, recommend this one, 7/10.",

        "description": "STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulGary Johnson (Glen Powell) is a high school teacher, with a side hustle helping the police on the side. One day, he is selected to work in a series of undercover sting operations, getting wire-tapped confessions from those planning on arranging contract killings. But things take a misfiring turn, when he ends up falling for one of his assignments, in the shape of Madison (Adria Arjona), a young woman at the behest of her abusive ex, only for things to take a massive turn when crooked agent Jasper (Austin Amelio) gets in on their arrangement.There was a film from 1997 called Grosse Pointe Blank, that received some critical acclaim at the time despite a limit in much of the way of a wide release. Writer/director Richard Linklater's film would seem to owe much of its inspiration to this source, and seems to be another well received subversive take on the 'hitman' genre, spinning conventional wisdom of the standard tropes of films featuring these characters on their head at one point, with a colourful montage of past films from this genre, from some of the oldest ones to more modern stuff like 2008's In Bruges.Linklater's film seems a confusing jumble of genres, with elements of action, comedy and thriller thrown into the mix, but somehow keeps you engaged with everything that's going on, an original, engaging film, with its sly, wise-cracking script never letting up, and never letting the pace sag. It helps that the cast are all relatively unknown, and so no one overshadows the script or film in itself. That said, lead stars Powell and Arjona are perfectly up to the job, Powell curiously convincing as a man who can alternate between mild mannered lecturer and guy caught up in the criminal underworld, whilst Arjona is a sultry seductress who serves as a perfect foil to everyone's plans.It's an unsteady combination of different genres, and as a result it sometimes comes off weirdly, most notably with a morally iffy ending that could leave you feeling funny. But somehow, it all works, and you're left with one of the most original and worthwhile efforts in a while. ****",

        "description": "Disappointing movie, despite great performances by Powell, the guy who played the other undercover policeman and supporting cast, good cinematography. There were so many plot holes and unbelievable situations that made this a bad movie, despite best efforts from everyone involved. From plot elements and settings from movies like \"Body Heat\", \"American Psycho\" and \"Twin Peaks\", I guess there was foreshadowing that in the end, we would are going to discover that the 2 main characters are just your typical garden variety psychopaths/murderers. The things that happen in the movie are unbelievable. The way Powell's character Gary starts to act once we find out what Madison really is doing is unbelievable. The movie completely falls apart when we find out the truth and the story becomes completely ridiculous at that point. Along with the silly \"The idea of You\", this movie and others being churned out have beautiful stars with great acting talent and sexy love scenes, but the scripts are stupid, poorly written and derivative. Cringed hard for the pilot fantasy scene. Hoping Powell's next movie will have a good script. The Brooke Shield's rom com was horrid as well - one of many terrible movies out there. The film business is in real trouble.",

He's a university professor who also finds himself working for the New Orleans police department pretending to be a hit man so as to entrap potential killers who don't want to do the killing themselves.It's totally far-fetched but who says that even 'true' stories have to be believable ; as a certain Mr. Hitchcock said, 'it's only a movie' and this 'screwball-rom-com-neo-noir' certainly is no documentary and as a genre piece it hits all the right buttons while still managing to appeal to the usual Linklater aficionados.

Arjona actually has a lot of charm and reminds me of Meghan Markle with a few brief flashes of Monroe.The plot is fine - although it all goes on too long and 40 minutes pass before we even see Arjona. However, after that it picks up and as the plot thickens I actually started to care about how they would get out of the mess they were in.And then we have three inexcusable errors:-1. Arjona apparently is the person who murdered her husband. This is a twist I didn't expect to see and although - sure - it does indeed make things more difficult and sets up an amusing scene where Powell has to silently coach Arjona what to say while they're being listened to by the cops on his wire, are we really supposed to give her a pass for murder? I mean, she's cute, but not that cute!2. In order to cover up the fact that she murdered her husband Powell then proceeds to murder in cold blood the (admittedly annoying) cop who's figured out the truth and is trying to shake them down for the insurance money. Sure, he's not a nice guy, but our leads have committed TWO murders now and we're still supposed to be on their side?3. And then, to top it all off, instead of them both dying in an accident or getting their just desserts (not pie) in some other way... THEY JUST LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER on the insurance payout from murdering her husband!Seriously, whoever thought it was acceptable to make a comedy where both the main characters commit murder and then live happily ever after with no retribution whatsoever is a disturbingly morally deficient individual.And then the movie production company approved this and it gets an 85 review score on Metacrtitic?Am I losing my mind here, or is there something seriously wrong with the society we're living in these days?2/10 because Arjona is cute.",

        "description": "In Richard Linklater's Hit Man, philosophy lecturer Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) ponders the question of how many people truly know themselves. The film tells the story of Johnson working for the New Orleans Police Department as a fake hit man for its sting operations. He is an amiable, Honda Civic-driving, bird-watching Everyman in shorts and glasses, who turns out to be the perfect fake assassin. Despite his unreadable face, Gary gets the gig at a moment's notice because the usual guy got caught beating up teens and got himself a 120-day suspension. However, Gary is a natural and convincingly transforms into a badass as soon as he meets his mark. This is similar to the scene in Collateral where Jamie Foxx's mousy cabbie has to pose as Tom Cruise's stone-cold assassin and suddenly becomes a new man. Glen Powell's performance in Hit Man might make him a movie-star because it is at heart a fantasy. Gary plays a figure out of our collective imagination, playing a figure out of our collective imagination. He researches his clients beforehand and tailors his look for their expectations of a hit man, making up the character as he sees fit. He meets Madison (Adria Arjona), a terrified wife being tormented by an unstable, domineering husband. She tries to hire Gary, but he slyly convinces her to give up on the idea because he doesn't want her going to prison. They fall in love, but she thinks he's still \"Ron,\" the grizzled, open-collared killer who showed her some genuine compassion and impromptu life coaching. Gary also thinks he's Ron, or at least becomes Ron whenever he's with her, so much so that he's now a demon in bed. He has the instincts of a tougher guy when they're together, and when Madison's estranged husband spots them at a club and threatens them, Gary immediately pulls out a gun, Clint Eastwood-style, and backs him off. Hit Man is a film that deconstructs the concept of stardom by presenting a character we cannot be, and then making us believe we can be him. The film's amiable filmmaking and Powell's charming, self-aware swagger are infused with the idea that anything is possible, making the world seem open, malleable, and accepting. The auteur theory has been criticized for its lack of focus on the material, but Linklater's breeziness and generosity as a director work wonders in this film. It serves as a rebuke to other hit-man movies at Venice this year, such as David Fincher's The Killer and Harmony Korine's Aggro Dr1ft. Linklater's film feels genuinely fresh, with fun for the star and the audience. The film's overt philosophical digressions, such as Gary's lectures to his classes, are easygoing and lively. Linklater's gentle touch is his secret weapon, and Hit Man might be a masterpiece. The film's overt philosophical digressions, in the form of Gary's lectures to his classes, are equally easygoing and lively.",

A director who has known how to provide great black comedies, once again achieves the task of satisfying us as viewers with an intelligent, well-thought-out and very well-structured film, which in turn leads you to immediately connect with a story that seems to be going too slowly, but That, just like its protagonist, makes an immediate click and we don't realize how deeply we are immersed in a plot that captivates us as each dialogue passes.Also for everything to work perfectly we need effective protagonists and Glen Powell shows everyone that he is an actor who is efficiently reaping his current moment of recognition, beyond the physical appearance, he is also a very good actor and Here we can see it in all its dimension and in all its aspects that allow it to shine from beginning to end. In that same place we can leave Adria Arjona, who possibly gives one of her strongest performances to date, complementing herself and sharing her level with her co-star without having to reproach an actress who is on the rise. Two incredibly well-written and very well-acted characters with whom it is impossible not to have a connection with them.It is such an intelligent film that hides behind its title all the deception that its characters possess, it is a clever and hilarious comedy that incredibly in its dialogues hides the best weapon to provide you with the most absolute entertainment so far this year. We are left with a sexy and ingenious proposal that is positioned as an entertaining proposal beyond the explosions and chases. A captivating comedy that dares to narratively go beyond the commonplaces that logic might presume. The Linklater style is more than present in the one that also elevates a new Hollywood star like Glen Powell.A satisfactory film in all its aspects that crosses different genres without clashing in any of them and allowing itself to establish itself as one of the most refreshing proposals so far in 2024. It deserves to be seen and enjoyed and to indulge in the fun of an original proposal , conquering, exciting and perfectly achieved.",

Nonetheless, Gary's ex-wife (Molly Bernard) encourages him to liven up his personality.Suddenly, Gary meets Madeline Masters (Adria Arjona), a beautiful young woman who wants to have her husband, Ray (Evan Holtzman), killed. Rather than trap her, Gary encourages her to flee her husband and begin her own life. Soon, Gary and Maddy begin a relationship in which she still believes Gary is a hitman, and Gary's police colleagues are unaware of his relationship with a potential suspect. The movie then unfolds through many twists and turns that threaten their relationship and their trust in one another.\"Hit Man\" is a supremely clever story loosely based on a real Gary Johnson in Houston. It has a romantic comedy edge against a film noir backdrop. Powell and Arjona have excellent chemistry. The script lags a little in the middle but sprints to the end and has a good film noir ending.",

Glen Powell shines as Gary Johnson, a professor moonlighting as a faux hitman, whose moral compass spins wildly in a New Orleans tinged with noir. The film's brilliance lies in its fluid identity, effortlessly shifting from comedy to thriller, ensnaring viewers in its philosophical quandaries. Richard Linklater's direction is masterful, crafting scenes that are as intellectually stimulating as they are visually arresting. The narrative's twists are both unpredictable and satisfying, leaving audiences pondering the true nature of change. A standout feature that redefines the genre, \"Hitman 2023\" is not just a movie; it's a cerebral journey that captivates and challenges in equal measure.",

It goes over like a lead balloon.Most of the hitman scenes are comical and it just gets worse over time, eventually becoming a full on rom-com from the 80's.I expect more from a movie than retold situations that have been done over and over. Provide the audience with something new and interesting. And when the writer attempted that here it's not good and so awkward.The wrap up ending and mostly silly overacting do not help Glen Powell attempt to replace Ben Stiller and all the critics are saying this is a 8-10 star film. That implies that there aren't any mistakes or that you'd watch it again. Highly doubtfull. 4/10, some average parts but mostly a retread movie dressed up.",

Thus, I had an initial hesitation about watching this solely because I thought it would come out to be a letdown by comparison. But no, Glen Powell signed on to another entertaining extra-base hit. He showed good range between his two characters and has a natural charisma to him. I'm not the least bit bothered by the ending....some reviewer above complained about 'killing the honest cop'....excuse me?....blackmail/extortion extols someone's honesty? Neither the abusive husband's nor the sleazy, opportunistic cop's demise put me off. They were threats to the protagonists' life (and/or life together). Nor do I have no complaints about the female lead's appearance, mannerisms or acting ability. She was perfectly fine for the role. The chemistry quotient between the leads was adequate for the job. This is an easy movie to just sit back and enjoy. It has some plot twists to provide a little edge, but not so much to be hard to follow.",

The humours and twists & turns of the story were entertaining. The ending, however, was overly simplified and short that left unsatisfactory taste in my brain. With this kind of story, it's probably better to hang it rather than close the chapters with overly simplified and happy ending.Glen Powell is certified hunk to watch for in the future. He made the right moves to be likable and bankable leading star. And the small casts of actors did well, at least for this film. The heavy lifting was always in 2 hands, Linklater and Powell.For those who doesn't know Richard Linklater's works, such as Dazed and Confused, you might want to check his older films. Hit Man is an easy box office hit, a winning date night film for chilling with romantic evening.

Movies can do so much, this does the absolute basic minimum.I could feel the Netflix-level movie quality within the first 5 minutes. It's not cinematic at all. 90% of this movie is narration or a two-person conversation, usually in a booth of some sort, with regular cuts back and forth to each character.

Zero imagination or ingenuity.Some people might still be able to enjoy it, but all I'm left with is a barely serviceable romantic-comedy which could barely make me chuckle.

She is a knockout ( especially in her red dress). One thing I don't think it is a comedy. More like Black Comedy such as MASH or The Trouble With Harry ( although I preferred Hit Man to both), it is about a hit man named Gary John ( Glen Powell), who falls for his target ( Madison). Of course just looking at her it is pretty easy to do so, Spoilers ahead: Do they end up together? Yes they do ( although people get killed like her abusive husband and a crooked cop). I am a huge fan of the ending where they are married with children ( and still in love with each other). Why? I despise ambiguous endings.

But Gary's no ordinary police informant. He uses his acting chops to become a charismatic, costumed \"hitman\" to lure in potential murderers. Enter Madison (Adria Arjona), a desperate wife looking to off her cheating husband. Gary, however, is more charming than lethal and soon finds himself falling for her and trying to talk her out of the crime.Things get messy (in a hilarious way) when a crooked cop, played perfectly by the ever-despicable Austin Amelio, gets suspicious. This is where the movie truly shines. We find ourselves rooting for Gary and Madison, even though they're technically the bad guys. The witty dialogue and clever situations keep the laughs coming, and the chemistry between Powell and Arjona is undeniable.If you're looking for a fun, action-packed comedy with a surprising heart, Hitman is a must-watch.

        "title": "\"Hit Man\": A Neo-Noir Masterpiece in Exploring Identity and Morality",
        "date": "11 June 2024",
        "description": "Known for his distinct storytelling style and vision, director Richard Linklater has returned once again with his latest film, \"Hit Man\", a neo-noir genre that highlighted Linklater's keen observations on human nature. The film stars Glen Powell as Gary Johnson, a seemingly strait-laced professor who leads a double life as a fake hitman for the New Orleans Police Department with a mission to capture these frustrated murderers. Gary's unique talent for adopting various guises and personalities enables him to trap those who wish to eliminate someone. However, his professional and ethical boundaries came to blur when he was contacted by Madison, played by Adria Arjona, to hire him to kill her husband. As Madison falls for one of Gary's personas---the sexy Ron---their steamy relationship ignites a series of play-acting, deception, and escalating stakes.The most effective aspect of the movie lies in the moral and psychological dilemma faced by the protagonist, Gary. As a professor, he teaches ethical principles promotes clear-cut notions of right and wrong, and identifies yourself. Yet, his secret activities forced him to navigate a morally ambiguous persona, creating a stark contrast between his personal and professional undercover work. This contradiction sets the stage for profoundly exploring his identity and ego. Gary's struggle to separate his true self from the various personas he adopts adds another layer to his characterization. This internal conflict is vividly shown, making viewers think about what really shapes our identity and how it changes based on the different roles we play in life and the different people we interact with.The main concept of the movie is the five-factor model of personality--- extraversion, neuroticism, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. This framework created another layer to the main character's emotional depth. Throughout the film, Gary has presented different types of personas and it begs the question as to where amongst the five factors does his personality change belong. This idea isn't just interesting but also makes the story deeper, offering a lot to think about for anyone curious about psychology and how characters develop. It makes you wonder about how flexible our identities can be and how outside events shape who we are, adding a unique psychological twist to the movie.The screenplay is also one of the movie's greatest strengths. Co-written by Richard Linklater and Powell, the movie serves as a masterclass in the simplicity and ingenuity of the script. In general, movies don't have to rely heavily on grand and over-the-top dramatic twists, and this is where \"Hit Man\" excels. The screenplay focuses on the nuanced character development and clever plot turns that allow the audience to be continually engaged. The writing in this movie is very tight, witty, and full of subtle surprises, despite having some pacing issues in the first two acts, the movie's clever script and engaging dialogues make it compelling and fun to watch. Powell's involvement in the screenplay is a pleasant surprise for me as well, this showcases his versatility beyond acting and proving his capability as a writer.Glen Powell's performance is nothing short of a revelation. To be honest, one of my worries in this movie is Glen Powell, I fear that he might just be another boy next door, potentially making his performance less convincing. However, Powell dispels these doubts with his multifaceted portrayal of Gary and his various personas. His ability to seamlessly transition from one character to another, each with its own unique charm and complexity, is genuinely impressive. The chemistry between Powell and Arjona adds another layer of intensity and sensuality to the film. Their dynamic as actors embodies a dark and romantic comedy vibe that fits well within the neo-noir genre which allows the narrative to be very enriching and emotionally deep.Despite its strength, the movie is far from perfect. The pacing in the first and second acts can feel sluggish, as the narrative takes its time to build up Gary's undercover exploits. This slow and gradual build-up can be very overwhelming to some viewers, making you question the direction of the story and where it's heading. The film spends a considerable amount of time establishing Gary's various personas, and in the 2nd half, the relationship buildup between Gary and Madison is overtly done. However, as the movie progresses and once we've reached the 3rd act, the movie brings clarity and resolution, tying together the movie's themes and character arcs in a satisfying conclusion. At 1 hour and 50 minutes, the movie could have benefited from tighter editing to maintain a more consistent pace and keep the audience more engaged throughout.Overall, \"Hit Man\" has all the elements of a perfect film-smart writing, good performances, and an unusual Bonnie and Clyde love story. The writing is clever, simple, and with the right amount of twists that work seamlessly with the material. It stands out as a crowd-pleasing addition to the neo-noir genre and is a testament to Richard Linklater's skillful storytelling. Despite its pacing issues, the film ultimately delivers a compelling narrative that resonates with audiences. Glen Powell's performance and the clever exploration of identity make \"Hit Man\" a memorable and thought-provoking cinematic experience. The film's visual style is another standout feature, with Linklater's keen eye for detail creating a world that feels both grounded and surreal. The New Orleans setting provides a rich, atmospheric backdrop that complements the film's themes of deception and identity. The cinematography captures the city's moody, noir-esque ambiance, adding another layer of depth to the narrative.In true Richard Linklater fashion, \"Hit Man\" is a home run, solidifying its place in his impressive filmography. The film's unique blend of psychological depth, moral ambiguity, and romantic intrigue makes it a standout in the neo-noir genre, offering a narrative that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally engaging.In conclusion, \"Hit Man\" is a film that succeeds on multiple levels. It is a smart, engaging, and thought-provoking addition to the genre, with strong performances, a compelling narrative, and a unique exploration of identity and morality. Richard Linklater and Glen Powell have created a film that is both entertaining and intellectually stimulating, proving that the neo-noir genre still has plenty of room for innovation. Whether you're a fan of Linklater's previous work or new to his filmography, \"Hit Man\" is a film that is sure to leave a lasting impression.",

        "description": "Directed and written by Richard Linklater. A runtime of one hour and fifty-five minutes.

He's a professor teaching general psychology, but in his spare time, he works with the local police force. Doing of all things being a fake hitman.It didn't always start that way. At first, he only worked on the technical side of things. Working with \"Phil,\" played by Sanjay Rao, \"Claudette,\" played by Retta, and \"Jasper,\" played by Austin Amelio. \"Jasper\" who you might remember from playing \"Dwight\" in \"The Walking Dead\" was the head undercover officer playing a hitman.When \"Jasper,\" who is a scumbag, got suspended, they needed someone on the fly to help. \"Gary\" was forced on the spot to fill in for \"Jasper.\" A decision that affected his life forever.Being better than even \"Jasper\" was, which was a shock to everyone. Plus he wasn't a cop officially. \"Gary\" used elaborate disguises and could somehow tap into the head of the person who was trying to order a hit. Getting many people arrested and saving a lot of lives.But a woman named \"Madison,\" played by Adria Arjona, who was looking for \"Gary's\" services, threw a monkey wrench into the op. Now being clouded by beauty and getting lost in disguise. \"Gary\" is going to be forced to make a lot of difficult decisions and be tempted to lead a stray. In this surprisingly based on a true story film.\"Hit Man\" was another home run by Glen Powell. Who was also a producer, helped create the story, and was involved with this film from top to bottom. This was his baby, and he did a great job with it.The acting was great, and the story was so intriguing. A lot of films I've watched recently have been so entertaining, partly because they are derived from true events. It just makes things better when you think about how this happened.Unfortunately, the real Gary Johnson passed away. He was an intriguing man who had a true calling, I can't lie. Some stuff was dramatized, but a lot was real. It's fascinating. He should be cheered for all the lives he saved.Glen Powell is on a heater, and he has another potential smash coming our way next month in \"Twisters.\" Let's see if he can keep shooting at this clip. Anyway, this was a fun film that was entertaining and frustrated you at times. But all in a good way.

The actors all did a fantastic job, the script was sharp, well written and didn't distract from the plot. There was a lot of spark between the characters, backed up by no over-padding back stories, they just laid it out there and enjoyed the ride. I wouldn't go so far as to call it an out and out comedy, but it was humourous in an intelligent way. There was a certain amount of predictability but I also caught myself being denied some leading assumptions. If I were to be critical in any way it would be that the pacing at the beginning was a little laboured, we really didn't need to see all those perps being stung and the personalities of the main character, but I understand why the writer felt the need to embed his chameleon-like persona. I do think it could have gotten away with being a bit darker, and the ending was a bit too sugar-coated for me - more akin to a rom-con, and it could have again, gotten away with being more of a thriller/noir type movie, with a bit more of a twist at the end.

Richard Linklater, one of the most captivating writer-directors of our times, is the guy behind that (sudden) change of perspective. He brings them together in such a fun, quirky little rom-com that takes advantage of their sizzling chemsitry. Like, wow. I didn't think Powell could actually take on a role with not one, but two personas embedded within. Arjona is too darn hot, and I like her even more when she moves as good as she speaks. And then, there are the signature Linklater dialogues on life's little pleasures, and random stuff like the cosmos, fish, signing contracts, pies, slicing fingertips, and whatnot. Gosh, not many can treat ARTICULATION like the sexy skill it is.. King Richard Linklater and his intriguing philosophies, I'm forever SOLD!The humor in the film is candid, subtle, and situational. There are some great puns and parallels drawn, with dialogues doing a lot of the work. What stops me from rating this any higher is the rather convenient ending (which I kinda foresaw) and it lacked the element of surprise that the rest of the film was nearly able to pull off. But for what it's worth, this once again proves that two actors who are better known for their physical appearance, can in the hands of a great director, impress you with their performances. The foreplay/sex scenes in the film are magnificently executed, and you'll almost feel the HEAT occupying the entire room. To think this was the exact opposite I felt when I saw Glen Powell & Sydney Sweeney together in Anyone But You.. speaks volumes!P. S. Full marks for the Patrick Bateman reference.",

Glen Powell takes the lead as the most lovable fake hitman this side of the silver screen, delivering one-liners and dodging bullets with a roguish wink that's bound to steal hearts and illicit chuckles. His partner in crime, Adria Arjona, holds her own with snark and sass, making this dynamic duo an absolute delight to watch. Their back-and-forth banter crackles with such electric chemistry, you'd think they were trying to out-charm each other in every scene.Plot-wise, imagine a blender filled with action, comedy, and a sprinkle of absurdity-and then imagine it explodes. That's this movie. It's a wild mash-up of genres that dances dangerously close to the edge of ridiculousness without ever tumbling over. Each plot twist is more surprising than the last, serving up a deliciously unpredictable narrative that keeps you guessing whether you're still watching a comedy or if you've stumbled into a thriller by mistake. The action sequences? Think ballet with bullets. It's so over-the-top that you can't help but applaud the audacity.So, why does this cinematic carnival ride earn a solid 4.5 stars?

        "description": "In a world where remakes are the only trend besides big budget super hero movies, this is a fun refreshing and unique look at the romcom. While there are some moments that drag, the story is engaging, the romance is enough to excite but not gratuitous. It's a fun movie that can be shared over a bottle of wine and slightly burnt popcorn. Probably the biggest hang up is the overly muscular lead that works as a psychology teacher with too many cats, but some how has the body of a Navy pilot. 😜 The rest of the ensemble is perfect and not too much time is spent on useless back story. The willing suspension of disbelief is perfectly balanced in this Friday date night movie you can enjoy with your better half.",

        "description": "\"Hit Man\" is probably the best romantic comedy I've seen in recent years. Typically, I avoid this genre due to its tendency toward shallow plots, clichés, and poor acting. However, \"Hitman\" breaks the mold with a well-produced, directed, and performed film that boasts an original premise.The delivery is brilliant, offering a slow-burn of mental stimulation that gradually builds. At around the one-quarter mark, the depth of the acting and the philosophical undertones provide an exhilarating high.Glen Powell is a true chameleon, showcasing his craft in the finest manner. His performance is nothing short of artful. Adria Arjona, on the other hand, brings a subtle unease to her role, hinting that something is amiss. Her nuanced acting is a testament to her talent.",

He consults on a police undercover team that targets clients hiring assassins. One day, the official undercover detective (Jasper) is suspended just as the team are onsite waiting to meet a 'client'.Gary is sent in and has to improvise. Surprisingly, mild Gary becomes a chameleon (Ron the hitman). Morphing into a variety of hitman characters that the clients trust. Incriminating the clients who are arrested after they hand over a down-payment.One 'client' is a pretty wife (Madison) that wants to have her abusive husband killed. Gallantly, Gary/Ron sends her on the way with advice to leave her husband (Ray). Unfortunately, Gary is smitten by this winsome woman. Foolishly, he follows up on Madison on his own time.The scheming Madison seduces Gary because she believes that he is Ron, a genuine killer. Learns how to murder Ray from her unsuspecting lover.To Gary's horror, Ray is shot to death. Suspicion falls on Madison because of a million dollar insurance policy. That's why the scheming Madison doesn't just divorce her husband. She also wants a payday after ditching her husband.At this point, anything could have happened. Had Gary come clean and helped trap Madison, Gary would have remained the mild psychology professor. Instead, Gary becomes an accomplice by shielding Madison. Helping her deceive the police.Then, there is the complication when Jasper (the undercover detective) gets greedy. Extorts the couple for the million door insurance policy. The psychopathic Madison drugs Jasper, and Gary chooses to suffocate Jasper. Using his experience to make it seem like a suicide.The deception works. Gary and Madison escape detection. Get married and have children. Somehow, the accomplices live happily after.There was the possibility of other outcomes Madison could have ditched Gary after getting her payday. Possibly, Madison stayed with Gary because he turned out to be a real life Ron (the bad boy).After all the criminality, Gary becomes more confident. Was there always a Ron hiding in Gary?The movie maker has cleverly posed the question. Who are we? Can we become the characters we play? Or, will the real person emerge under the right circumstances?Based on a real life character in Texas who helped entrap 60 clients looking to hire an assassin.IMO, the film would have been stronger with a better script. More tenson between Gary/Ron and Madison. The murderers turning on each other before reconciling.",

The film is based off a true story and centers around a quirky college professor named Gary who works part time for law enforcement playing a fake hitman to entrap and arrest those attempting to seek one out.The movie has plenty of jokes to go around and when the cop who primarily portrayed the fake hitman loses his thunder to Gary, the quirky college professor delves even more further into the job creating disguises and personas even quirkier than himself. It is upon meeting a beautiful damsel in distress named Madison that Gary creates a suave and friendly hitman persona named \"Ron\" that a fireworks of chemistry ensue between them.This is when the film hits its stride as Gary becomes more like \"Ron\" as the movie progresses until he essentially becomes this persona especially towards the dark ending when someone does end up dead and Madison is linked to it.I'm not against dark endings but this one felt a bit strange in that things go from dark and then happy go lucky so quickly you can't help but feel slightly disturbed instead of happy for Gary.Overall, a solid Linklater film that is funny with great dialogue that really shines due to Glen Powell and Adria Arjona's performances.",

        "date": "10 June 2024",
        "description": "In a lot of ways, \"Hit Man\" was a true-romance story instead of a true-crime one. It featured a so-called notorious undercover hitman who fell in love when least expected, thereby establishing a macabre rom-com undertone that was thoroughly entertaining.Imagine being mistaken for a good guy when you're working as a professional killer-for-hire, but only pretending to do so on the police's behalf, and in New Orleans to boot.That's what happened to Gary Johnson, who was played to outstanding effect by Glen Powell, who was casually funny, intense when needed, and charming otherwise. He was a psychology professor whose skills the police needed to cinch certain criminals, but then he got deep into the heart of things and lost his way; or rather, found a new one.The message at the heart of \"Hit Man\" became clear when Gary broke his own rules to help one of the contract-killer hirers - Madison Figueroa Masters (played engagingly by Adria Arjona) - escape her abusive husband Ray Masters (played notably by Evan Holtzman).There was a predictable twist connected to her character, but nothing so bad as to ruin the plot. A feel-good story coupled with rom-com vibes thus unfolded, with a generous helping of intrigue and humour.\"Hit Man\" 2024 contained a wealth of pleasant surprises. For starters, it felt like the story tapped into the ever-high demand for murder-misadventure tales and gave it a romantic twist, with an undercover civilian pretending to play a cut-throat character to bust various criminal endeavours.The movie also had a welcome 80s vibe. But what I genuinely admired about it was the fact that it was all based on a true story, and a very real Gary Johnson who worked as a college instructor (psychology and philosophy) by day and moonlighted as an undercover hitman for the New Orleans police.Sanjay Rao (as Phil), Retta (as Claude), Austin Amelio (as Jasper), and Gralen Bryant Banks (as Sergeant Hank) did good work as the NOPD crew. Molly Bernard (as Alicia; Gary's civilian ex) gave a memorable performance as well.As for the wide-ranging list of contract-killer hirers, Mike Markoff (as Craig), Bryant Carroll (as Walt), Martin Bats Bradford (as Isaac), Jo-Ann Robinson (as a posh woman), Jonas Lerway (as Monte), Kate Adair (as Rita), Morgana Shaw (as Tammi), Ritchie Montgomery (as Marcus), and Richard Robichaux (as Joe) were all caricatured down to a T but nonetheless gave engaging (though brief) performances. According to Press reports, the real Gary Johnson died - 1947-2022. Obvious conspiracy theories notwithstanding, \"Hit Man\" was a careful nod to one of the shadiest professions still in existence today; don't let some of the dialogues in this movie make you believe otherwise.The plot also insinuated that even in the coldest of hearts, there might be the need to go good and help the innocent. But don't go trusting your friendly community killer after reading that line. Not all of them are keen on being as nice as Gary Johnson was, and he was the goddamned police (irony-sarcasm intended).The movie ended on a dark note, rife with psychological subtext but no real-life parallels. The OG Gary Johnson was, apparently, the \"chilliest dude imaginable\". There were also some interesting noir-movie easter eggs worth appreciating.\"Hit Man\" was one of the few movies to surprise me this year. For a story based on grim true-crime cases, its protagonist came across as skillfull, heroic, and entertaining in all the right ways. Such characterisation balance was genuinely admirable.\"All pie is good pie.\"--- --- ---\nSpecial shout-out to Kim Baptiste (as a defence lawyer), John Raley (as a defence lawyer), Jordan Salloum (as Ray's friend), Stephanie Hong (as Mindy), Joel Griffin (as Peter), KC Simms (as Jerren), and Murphee Bloom (as Gwen).",

Sad that these actors are considered rising stars from this absolute dumpster fire.The start was actually promising. I was genuinely enjoying it and really thought I'd like Glenn Powell or whatever his name is. I'd never even heard of him before this but yikes, my hopes came down crashing and burning like all my expectations in men do. What on Earth was this? His acting is okay at best. Not great, but good enough to watch, but that's really it. The multiple disguises he did...eh, I didn't buy it. How did none of the people he hired find him suspicious? The Russian accent was so over the top, it was like he was cosplaying. Anyway, 50 minutes into the movie and nothing, and I mean NOTHING was happening. Just a montage of him going through different disguises. Seriously, what is this movie supposed to be? A comedy? Well, no, it wasn't funny. A romance? There wasn't much of a romance, just a whole bunch of making out and sex so it was more of an erotica. I sensed no chemistry for it, by the way, so that wasn't very believable either. Just made for awkward kink scenes. Instead of exploring the dilemma of Gary having to follow his morals and choosing justice over a woman he's falling in love with (which would have made for a more suspenseful movie), he turns into a murderer for a woman he just met and swaps his cats for dogs for her. It was giving hard simp energy. Gag me now. Aren't we supposed to like the leads in a movie?Also, how is Gary so comfortable and confident that very first time he had to fake being a hitman? It doesn't make sense. There's no internal or external struggle or anything outside of his teaching job that shows us that he's comfortable in switching personalities. We're supposed to be engaged with him, worry for him and fear for him fricking up his first mission. Now that would have been fun to see, especially him growing as a character. It falls flat because he almost seems too perfect at it. Just because he's seen other cops do it doesn't mean he can do the same. That's like saying I've helped around on movie sets and seen people act for years so that must mean I can act.I'm even more surprised by the positive reviews that seem to be slapped across my face everywhere. These people must either be paid or they just like jumping on the band wagon of anything that Hollywood critics claim is 'good', which by now I know to believe the exact opposite.The moral message of this movie is messed up and kinda evil. Because there is no morals. The only message that stands out to me is that murder is okay because love prevails. A bucket load of horse dung if you ask me.Gary is smitten the moment he sees the FL (I forgot her name lol oops). She tries to justify her desire to see him dead because he is bad, but this is never shown. She wants to kill him because...uh, he didn't like her wearing miniskirts? Oh no, what a piece of unworthy trash! It wasn't like she was in an abusive relationship because she literally just ups and leaves him. If it was that easy, why wasn't that her first move? She really needed some random hit man to tell her that for her to leave him. Isn't she an adult? That pretty much confirms her character: psychopath.Gary, as Ron, supports her despite him being shown as this sweet guy who is always on the right side of the law. Why? Because he's having sex with a woman that looks like a supermodel and he prolly wouldn't ever get a woman like that under normal circumstances as Gary. I understood why his ex wife left him, not because he refused to change but because he's lowkey pathetic. He saw the red flags and just decided to ignore them but boy, these weren't just red flags. These were blatant red sirens. She lied to him about getting divorced and lied to him about killing someone. I'm supposed to believe it'll end happily between them regardless of whether they have kids or not? Who's to say he won't end up like her ex? Does he find that hot? None of it made SENSE.We're also told Jasper is a jerk and sure, he's annoying and had an ulterior motive but he didn't deserve to die! When Jasper dies in front of them, Gary was shocked for only two minutes. He was strangely more calm about it. For someone who'd never seen a dead body before you'd think he'd react badly. He goes on to label Jasper as a racist, a misogynist to excuse the murder--the movie never shows Jasper as either of those so Gary literally had no qualms about slandering a poor dead dude to fit their convenience. To top it off, bro proceeds to make out/have sex with her despite there being a dead body right in front of them. Is this supposed to be funny? Sexy? No, it was vile. So really he's a murderous psychopath too, but we never get an indication of his fragile mental state tittering on the edge of snapping before all this. There is no mention of any sort of dissociative disorder either (which would have made a little more sense) so...he's throwing away any semblance of who he is as a person and his values for a stranger.Gary is clearly turned on by all this because he ends up dropping the L bomb at the end. I understand she's beautiful, but really? They don't even know each other or have anything in common, except for the fact that they're both insane. All the moments where they could have tried to make it into a good romcom is made meaningless by a script full of sex, boring dialogue and lacklustre acting. But I guess Hollywood relies on all that to keep the attention of hormonal teenagers---and to cover up the fact that there is literally no plot.This is the kind of rubbish Hollywood is throwing out there. Hard pass. If there is anyone telling you this is an amazing movie, just run.",

Support cast were largely awful, especially the jarringly terrible female lead who we will now actively try to avoid watching in anything in the future.Kept wondering who the terrible director was, and then recalling it was Richard Linklater... which makes it 10x worse somehow because I expect way more from literally ANY director than what was delivered here.Worse, in Canada we went to an actual theatre and paid theatre prices to see this mess of a movie, and now I see it was streaming on the Netflix platform in the US.This movie made us cranky and irritated. Not at all the fun quirky movie outing we had planned for. Save a precious 2 hours of your life and avoid this dreadful waste of time nonsense. I hope that by saving others from making the same mistake it might make our ordeal and waste of an afternoon at least minimally worthwhile.",

And he wanted his job back, and he thought that Gary took his job from him. Or, alternatively, he wanted them to pay him for silence. So yes, they killed him.So the movie creators think that these two deserved to die.

        "description": "I always look forward to the films of Richard Linklater, whom I consider one of the most interesting American filmmakers. His films manage to bring to the screens novel landscapes of American reality and characters that involve their viewers. His persistence in long-term projects has managed to transform time perspectives that span many years and decades into plots and images. Linklater is constantly looking for new characters to turn into stories on screen and new forms of expression to tell their stories. However, not all of his experiments are successful to my taste. This is also the case with 'Hit Man', an original combination which, however, failed to convince me.'Hit Man' is inspired by a real-life character named Gary Johnson, who lived in Houston and assisted the local police as an undercover agent, posing as a professional killer to those looking to buy assassination services and gathering evidence (mostly taped recordings of conversations) to arrest and prosecute them for planning murders. The script moves the action to New Orleans and assigns Gary the job of art teacher, showing him giving moral and life lessons to his young students. As long as he builds the character of the teacher who masquerades as different variants of professional killers, adapting his physiognomy and attitude to the 'clients', the film is interesting and funny. When the romantic component is added, it becomes less believable, not to mention the moral and legal ambiguities. What doesn't work? To a large extent, the role and activities of the police assistant hero are based on the first impression, or if you want, on the prejudices through which people judge those around them. The police disguises may fool the buyers of crime services, but the identity game on which the romantic story is based is more difficult to believe. A relationship based on false identities has no chance of standing the test of time. Or maybe the script wants to tell us that true love can overcome even lies about identity? Such a message is too trivial to support the surprises in the second part of the film. Linklater uses tools from the film noir toolkit mixed with romantic comedies and a little eroticism, but the combination just didn't work for me.Glen Powell is a good actor, but what he does in this movie constantly reminded me of Ryan Gosling and in cases like this I prefer the original. His romantic partner is played by Adria Arjona, who looks fantastic but whom I need to see in other roles to convince myself of her acting qualities. 'Hit Man' is a movie that many will like, OK as entertainment, but I found it to be one of Richard Linklater's weaker movies. In my opinion, this is one of the highly overrated movies of this season.",

The most interesting part of the film is actually the first act, when Glen Powell gets to shine in a diverse portfolio of characters, including a long, gritty dialogue exchange. By the time the love interest appears in the second act, the film has already fallen into just another collage of good cop/good person/bad circumstance entanglement.

Gary (Glen Powell) is a college professor and part-time staffer at the New Orleans Police Department. He stumbles into a new role as an undercover hitman, arresting people who try hiring him to kill someone. It turns out he's very good at it. Powell really showcases his talents here, playing different characters for each arrest. When he meets Madison (Adria Arjona) though, he breaks protocol. I guess Powell has great chemistry with whoever he works with. He has an undeniable charm that seems like it spreads to the whole cast. I could tell they had fun filming this. It also has a very smart script, playing with ideas of identity and being your true self. The strong sense of humour actually changes as the movie progresses, which was fun for me, but might not work for some. I find it hilarious that they must've asked the real Gary Johnson for permission to go as far as they do here. The movie makes it clear what actually happened during the end credits.

        "description": "Hitman is definitely a film-lover's paradise but even the casual film viewer will thoroughly enjoy this brilliant new movie. Linklater's latest lovingly pays homage to film noir, screwball comedy, Hitchcockian black comedy and even the good old psychosexual drama but it still somehow manages to conjure up a fresh, witty and often uproarious confection that frequently teases, delights and occasionally thrills the audience with frissons of excitement, keeping them enraptured all the way to its deliciously razor sharp ending.This is potentially a star-making turn for Glen Powell. Although he made a strong impression in Top Gun: Maverick as a cocky rival pilot, his role in Hit Man is easily more complex and, as the co-writer of the script, he has been able to add brilliant layers to his character, or should that be characters? In effect, Powell is playing more than one character - Gary Johnson, mild-mannered, cat-loving geeky Psychology professor and audio techie who moonlights as a surveillance expert for a Louisana-based police unit that targets and stings hapless ne'er-do-wells who are looking to hire a killer. Before the next sting operation, Gary's police colleague Jasper (Austin Amelio) who normally pretends to be the hired killer is suspended for brutally attacking two youths, which forces Gary's colleagues (brilliantly played by Retta and Sanjay Rao) into convincing Gary to take over from the universally loathed Jasper, much to Gary's dismay. Yet, within minutes of taking on the task, Gary suddenly morphs into \"Ron\" and during his first sting he is so convincing that his colleagues are shocked, even though they had believed he could do it having heard Jasper go through the rigamarole on previous occasions. It is a brilliant piece of acting.Having created the killer persona, Gary soon finds himself becoming more and more immersed in Ron, adding further, chameleon-like layers of disguise and character traits to mirror whoever is about to be stung. However, things become really complicated (in true film noir style) when \"Ron\" is approached by a femme fatale, Maddy (beautifully played by Adria Ajrona who also adds a delightfully a kooky sexy edge as well as a tender vulnerability). As the sparks between the two begin to fly during a hilarious but flirty exchange, Gary, who is clearly enjoying himself as Ron, finds himself conflicted. Dare he. As Ron, continue with the sting and have Maddy arrested for plotting to murder her husband? Has the flirtatious exchange caused Maddy to betray some regrets about what she is doing? The chemistry between Powell and Arjona is a pleasure to witness. Both actors bring out the best in one another and it is thrilling.Off-beat is an expression that would certainly apply to Hit Man - and it is a compliment. It is also one of the most enjoyable and fun 2 hours I've had in the cinema in the past few years. I absolutely adore this film.",

Seeing the magnificent Glenn Powell navigate the different personas he create for himself with considerable ease and suaveness is a great joy. But while this undercover average Joe turned hit-man idea may serve as an interesting premise, the film does not develop much from this premise meaningfully. The plot is overly slight, and the direction it goes is bizarre, especially the ending, which felt rushed and contrived. The plot does not develop in a manner which extracts full potential of comedy from its situation, and neither is it particularly entertaining. Also, Despite what some critics have praised, I could not see much chemistry between Arjona and Powell. Sure, they are both more than serviceable in their roles, and they share several steamy scenes, but there is no special spark or unique connection between the two. At the end of the day, I find Hit Man very similar to The Fall Guy, a movie released at around the same time. Both are serviceable, fun, and entertaining distractions which can barely hold and audiences attention for two hours. But both are overly light on actual plot, are only mildly entertaining, and not as funny or enjoyable as they should have been.",

        "description": "My first experience with Glenn Powell was his supporting role in Top Gun: Maverick. He's been around much longer but he was good at playing the brash and cocky Hangman. He's been noteworthy in previous efforts (Hidden Figures was also mentioned by one of my friends) but I was blown away by his work in Hit Man, not only is he fantastic as the suave and smooth Ron but he's also convincing as the reserved and stale Gary (I do have some thoughts on how they present Gary, more on that later). But watching him in Hit Man, it felt like I was watching someone doing acting gymnastics, he's playing so many different and bizarre characters and he nailed every single one. He also has great chemistry with his co-star Adria Arjona, I was just as interested in the their torrid romance than I was in what costume Gary was going to shuffle into next. Speaking of Adria, her work in this was also noteworthy, it would have been easy to make assumptions about Madison's character if Adria's performance didn't make her so mysterious and alluring. She's beautiful, she got her fair share of laughs from me and I was surprised at how invested I was in Gary and Madison's relationship by the end of the movie. I also wanted to credit Austin Amelio, Retta and Sanjay Rao for their collective work in their supporting parts. Another expectation the movie subverts is painting Jasper as a two dimensional villain, Austin makes Jasper unlikeable but not inhuman or not believable as Gary's dejected co-worker.Besides the performances, my favourite part of Hit Man was how it subverts the formula. I can't call it wholly and completely original but I was constantly trying to guess the next twist or shift in the narrative based on similar films. Hit Man continued to zag when I expected it to zig and it's so well layered. Director Richard Linklater and his team have a sense of when they need to switch things up, just when the movie gets too goofy, we get more time with Ron & Madison bonding or when you're about to guess when a twist will happen, the movie will suddenly get much darker. There's several tones at play but they are mixed together so precisely that it kept me entertained when I feel like another movie would have lost me.So many movies are \"based\" on a true story and sure enough, Hit Man isn't the unvarnished truth up on the screen. But the movie is cognizant of the fatigue that comes with this claim and admits it upfront. It helps that the true story is so fantastical that I wasn't bothered in how they tweaked it. Despite the changes, Hit Man is so good natured and seems to being celebrating Gary's unbelievable skill set that I didn't get bogged down in what was true and what wasn't.Hit Man slowly builds toward the finale and despite climax being morally murkier and darker tinged than I maybe expected, I loved how the ending punctuated what was a hugely enjoyable film. I was rooting for Gary/Ron and Madison despite what was revealed about them and it's captured wonderfully by Linklater. The movie doesn't pause to scold you for being sympathetic to one party or another and I liked that it wasn't too concerned with the absolute morality of the characters. The film ends with a metaphorical wink to the audience and it felt like a chef's kiss on a delicious meal.I'm going to be brief about any griping, My only problem is that they don't do a wholly convincing job of dressing Glen Powell down to be the nerdy and shy Gary Johnson when he's just being himself. It's reminiscent of sitcoms slapping glasses on models to trying to present them as dowdy. When everyone is making jokes about how \"normal\" and \"unassuming\" Gary looks, I rolled my eyes a little. But I guess Glen Powell being too handsome to be terribly convincing as a geek college professor is a nice problem to have.Hit Man was such a pleasant surprise, I felt like I was taking a gamble taking friends to see it in the theatre with me but we all walked out impressed. It made me a little sad that it was simultaneously released on Netflix, this is a theatre quality movie and while I understand it might have had a tougher road to profitability than your typical summer tentpole, it earned my ticket price. The film is so much fun, Glen Powell and Adria Arjona light up the screen and the fact that it's based on a true story is just delightful (I loved the end credits joke on how they changed the story). I tip my hat to Powell, Linklater & his team and the real Gary Johnson, I had a great time with Hit Man. I'd rate this at an 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9/10 and while you should check it out on Netflix, you won't regret going to see it in theatres either.",

        "description": "Richard Linklater's (Before Sunrise trilogy, Boyhood) latest film is getting very good reviews so it's quite a surprise once you see it that it's average at best. One of the reasons for that is the lack of variety and emotion Glen Powell puts in (or doesn't) in his performance. There should be a duality between his build-up cocky Ron hit man persona and Gary, his softer, nerdier, normal day-to-day self. Yet, when he supposedly switches between one and the other there's no real substantial difference between the two besides a cosmetic one. One would think this would be the role to show his acting prowess but there seems to be very little and this is nowhere near Bryan Cranston's duality performance skills as Walter White in Breaking Bad if we were to compare an actors task of switching between two sides of a character.There's never any palpable tension in Gary/Ron, he's always in control. He's in control when he becomes the face of the supposed hit-man for the first time (no nervousness, nothing), he is in control when everything starts to unravel, he's in control when he's being confronted with his actions during the climax of the film, and so on - and the film suffers very much from it as we never go along with the main character or actually worry about him, as the main actor never really does anything with it.Likewise, it's a bit boring at times, the cinematography is beyond plain and it's very predictable. The film would have been so much better had it been more stylised, with a more substantial visual flair and a cool soundtrack at least to cover its flaws, since overall there's not really much meat to the story and the film ends up being about nothing.",

It was the good part of this movie, and the funniest.Anathema (Love you Good Omen) is also hot. Like super hot. They are basically 2 good looking people in this twisted romcom story. The chemistry is good, their relationship portrayal is sexy and entertaining to watch but I do think the movie kinda drag on. There is no action or some set pieces, but it is pretty funny. It is not a bad movie at all but they really did cross the line morally lol.Honestly, I thought Ron (Glen Powell) would be a serial killer. He has the look and the wtf script he churned out during his interrogation. I think its just a funny twist if he turned out be a serial killer that just off bad people as a hobby. Like dexter. But some bits of the movie won't work.Overall, not a bad movie but kinda lacking something. But Glen Powell is amazing and I will support him and whatever movie he would be in.",

No local flavor from the the setting, which is weird - why choose NOLA then never use it in any way that enhances the film? The story is absurd and really very inane. Nothing in this is slightly funny, and it becomes witty and actually engaging for exactly one scene. The rest of this is borderline awful. The actor is smarmy and kind of a cross between Ryan Gosling and Christian Slater - neither of whom are all that great on their own. The situations shown are ridiculous and always look 100% scripted and nothing whatsoever like the way life on this planet actually occurs. The first entire 2/3 of this is a slog and a jumble of implausible and boring events, the it rises very slightly and briefly when the aforementioned One Good Scene occurs, only to divebomb very hard into a completely incomprehensibly ruinous ending. Bad storytelling, bad direction, bad script, The actors do their jobs well, but with so little to work with. A truly lightweight piece of product from an \"artist\" director.

There are maybe three other male actors right now in this category: George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt. Powell makes this movie work, his easygoing affability papers over the movie's contrivances and wobbly morality, and distracts from Linklater's bland, almost TV-movie like set-ups and blocking. Linklater's best films-Slacker, the Before Trilogy, Boyhood-present a consistent visual style, but most of his work is interchangeable with any number of directors-for-hire.",

We as a viewer saw no romantic or loving conversations in which they got to know each other better and I suppose that's part of the story with Gary being a supposed hitman and all, but it just makes the eventual romance seem sudden and odd.She then decides to drug a cop(!) in her own house(!!), Gary's just okay with it, finishes the job and it just fades into another sex scene and then fast forwards to where they have a happy family. You're telling me they killed a cop on the spot without any planning and alibis and got away with it? I really didn't expect this so called action comedy to end like that.",

        "date": "9 June 2024",
        "description": "\"Hitman,\" directed by Richard Linklater, is an intriguing yet uneven journey that offers glimpses of potential but ultimately falls short of being a memorable cinematic experience. Based on a true story, the film features commendable performances, particularly from Glen Powell, but suffers from a lack of character development and emotional depth.Glen Powell delivers a standout performance, embodying his character with a mix of charm and authenticity that makes him a compelling figure to watch. His nuanced portrayal brings a layer of believability to the narrative, making the moments of action and subtle humor particularly enjoyable. Powell's ability to infuse his role with both intensity and a touch of levity is one of the film's highlights.The movie does offer a few humorous moments that provide a welcome break from the otherwise serious tone. These lighter scenes are well-executed and add a layer of entertainment, making the film a decent choice for those looking for a casual watch. However, the humor alone is not enough to compensate for the film's more significant shortcomings.One of the primary issues with \"Hitman\" is its lack of character development. Despite the film being based on a true story, the characters feel underdeveloped and one-dimensional. There is a noticeable absence of emotional depth, which makes it difficult for the audience to connect with or care about the characters on a deeper level. This lack of character growth and exploration is a missed opportunity that could have elevated the film from being merely good to something truly impactful.Richard Linklater's direction, while competent, fails to fully capitalize on the story's potential. The narrative feels rushed at times, and the pacing issues detract from the overall impact of the film. There are moments that hint at deeper emotional and psychological layers, but these are never fully explored, leaving the audience with a sense of incompleteness.In conclusion, \"Hitman\" is a film that is good for passing the time but doesn't leave a lasting impression. Glen Powell's strong performance and the film's occasional humor make it worth a watch, but the lack of character development and emotional depth prevent it from being anything more than a mildly entertaining diversion. With a more nuanced approach to storytelling and character development, \"Hitman\" could have been much more impactful.",

I generally find his movies to be okay at best, but this one I did really like. We have a nerdy main character I can definitely relate to as a fellow nerd and a fellow educator.I did not really know who Glen Powell was before this. I had seen some movies he has a role in, but as he has been more of a character actor, I wasn't really aware of him. Here, he can kind of use that. He is supposed to be forgettable and learn to be something else.Powell also co-wrote the movie, his first feature as the writer. The story is nothing special. It's kind of obvious after the premises, but it does work nicely as something to hang all these jokes on.It doesn't really fall into copaganda either, which is a rarity.",

        "description": "Richard Linklater's career has been regularly punctuated by intense and innovative stories created from everyday beginnings. 'Hit Man' somehow achieves the opposite - it's a fluffy confection inspired by the real-life exploits of a psychology professor who masquerades a professional hit man while moonlighting for the police department. Gary Johnson carries out this pretense in order to entrap those looking to hire an assassin.The film's introductory sequences show restaurant encounters where he convinces several would-be murderers he's a hardened criminal in the liquidation business. These meetings are recorded, and the conspirators arrested after clearly stating their intent and handing over a down-payment. Linklater's narrative departs from reality when a beautiful Latina asks him to terminate her abusive husband. To the confusion of his handlers, Gary refuses her payment, and suggests she initiate divorce proceedings instead of contracting a homicide. Needless to say, complications ensue when he secretly starts an affair with her while maintaining his killer-for-hire persona.'Hit Man' could have followed in the footsteps of modern classics like 'Body Heat', but Linklater chooses to play it for light comedy rather than drama. Tension is lost as the proceedings become increasingly frivolous and unlikely. The acting performances and amusing screenplay just about hold one's interest, but the end-result feels like an insubstantial appetizer that could have been a memorable main course with a different approach.",

        "description": "The hitman is already for a long time a popular character in crime and (neo) noir films. For me the ultimate hitman-film is \"The day of the jackal\" (1973, Fred Zinnemann). In this film Edward Fox plays a hitman that is professional, emotionless and a typical loner.Only the last description does apply to Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) in \"The hit man\". He is however not a real hit man but an undercover hit man. He meets people looking for a hit man and makes sure the compromising evidence is on tape.In order to do this he changes outfit all the time and this leads to a comic costume parade, including an imitation of Anton Chigur (Javier Bardem), the hit man from \"No country for old men\" (2007, Ethan & Joel Coen).Being partly a comedy, \"Hit man\" is an odd one in the oeuvre of director Richard Linklater, who is mostly known for his \"Before .... \" relation trilogy (1995, 2004,2013) and his coming of age film \"Boyhood\" (2014).\"Hit man\" really takes of when Gary Johnson falls in love with one of his clients (Maddy Masters played by Adria Arjona). It is the starting point of a roller coaster of numerous unexpected twists and turns.One of the themes is losing sight of the difference between your undercover \"me\" and your real \"me\". It happens in numerous film, but it also happens in reality. In an investigation from 1994 - 1996 the Dutch parliament studied how it happened by the police while combatting organized crime.The fact is however that Gary Johnson has two real \"me's\", one as a part-time police officer and one as a professor in philosophy. The last one delivers the philosophical theme of the movie of how to find a satisfactory balance between ratio and discipline (represented by the Greek God Apollo) and feeling, emotions, instincts and living dangerously (represented by the Greek God Dionysus).Remarkable is that where his most famous films (The \"Before\" trilogy and \"Boyhood\") are typical for an Apollonian world, \"Hit man\" descends to the depths of Dionysus.By the way, \"Hitman\" is in my opinion not very flattering for women, showing how they prefer the sex appeal of a hit man to that of a \"dull\" police officer (let alone a nerdy professor).",

When one of their investigators \"Jasper\" (Austin Amelio) goes a bit too far and gets suspended, Gary gets drafted in last minute and proves quite effective at getting folks who want to bump of their nearest and dearest for $5,000 to admit their cunning plans to a well wired-up con. The more of these cases he does, the better he gets; the more fun he has dressing up and adept he becomes at assuming a range of identities. It's \"Maddy\" (Adria Arjona) who sets the cat amongst the pigeons when she asks him to get shot of her thuggish husband \"Ray\" (Evan Holtzman). He takes a shine to her and talks her out of her criminal ploy. Quickly the two are seeing each other - which is manna from heaven for the deposed \"Jasper\".

Gary's solution, as drugging a cop does not have the best looks: Killing the cop, obviously.And then, they live happily ever after.So we summarize: Maddy kills her husband probably for the insurance money, Gary covers it up by murdering a cop.

I find various movies these days don't offer this type of respect to real people or events and the idea of adding fantasy elements and blending them with reality results in some people believing it entirely. This results in a different view towards certain real people and events, which is all just very manipulative and upsetting.

It's the kind of story that, much like Edgar Wright's Baby Driver or Shaun of the Dead, would've made for a mediocre movie if directed by an amateur, but made for a great movie because it was directed by an experienced industry professional. All Linklater films are good films.This film keeps you guessing from beginning to end and tells its story in a way that makes the audience feel like they are learning and growing along with the characters. A great example of this is when the film periodically cuts back to Glen Powell's character, Gary Johnson, lecturing students on the everyday behaviors of people. Gary casually and subtly uses his experience as an undercover investigator as the building blocks for these lessons. By doing this, Gary is also introducing and breaking down the overarching themes of the film. It truly is brilliant storytelling.There will never be enough words to properly commend the actors in this film. They brought so much life and enthusiasm to their characters in constant battle between show stealers. In this battle, there were no winners or losers. The acting was balanced and cast members complimented their costars exquisitely.Linklater and Powell's writing was entertaining, truly comedic, well paced, and extremely thoughtful.

On the other hand, Gary shouldn't show that he's broken his own code to Madison because it could get him in trouble with the police and ruin his career.This film is based on a true story, where the real Gary Johnson posed himself to the police as a hitman who criminals could hire to commit murders. Only after sharing their murderous plans with Gary could the police catch them. The real Gary Johnson had to dress up so many times, wearing different styles of clothes and wigs to appear different to each criminal, so he couldn't be exposed as an undercover cop. Glen Powell also does the same at the beginning of the film. He wears different costumes and also acts in different ways. For example, the film starts off more like an action comedy, but when Gary falls for Madison, the film turns more into a romantic comedy.Richard Linklater provides a comic action film, but with repeated events, where Gary, in different disguises, makes various criminals confess. When the film later turns more into a romantic comedy, this mainly works because of the good chemistry between Glen Powell and Adria Arjona, their characters. Glen Powell only plays a character who leads a double life and his character ends up in a relationship with the possible criminal. This creates complicated situations in which he has to continue working strategically, without Madison or the police realizing that he is actually lying to both of them. However, the film does have a somewhat abrupt ending, which does not seem to answer everything.Glen Powell plays the lead role well and actually has to play the role in different ways. This gives him the opportunity to show different acting capabilities in this film. Adria Arjona also plays the role of a seductive, possible criminal well, because as a viewer, like the main characters, you do not always know whether she can be completely trusted. After his time in various Walking Dead series, Austin Amelio also gets the chance to act in a film. He plays a colleague of the main character, who may thwart his strategic plans if he is told too much.",

It was easy to believe he was each person he played because he did such a great job with each one.Adria Arjona also delivers a very convincing performance. Her character although not changing physically like Glen Powell, does demonstrate a multi-dimensional persona. The relationship that develops between these two characters is both romantic and thrilling. The rest of the cast is also good without a single flawed performance.There are some interesting psychological ideas explored in this movie. Not only were the ideas interesting but so was the manner in which they were delivered. Glen Powell's character Gary essentially would speak to his students about certain psychological ideas while simultaneously exploring these ideas as a hitman.Overall, this was a well written and interesting story. It's a good blend of comedy, romance and crime.",

They are completely dazzling together, and the ridiculous situation they find themselves in is beautifully choreographed by Richard Linklater, who directs them into and out of moments that'll have you amused and confounded simultaneously.This is one of the better \"new\" movies I have seen in a long time, and I have absolutely no problem highly recommending this. I wish Hollywood made more films like this, and I'll be perusing Linklater's catalogue to see what other hidden gems might be in lurking in there.

Glen Powell gives a pretty good performance of acting dorky and kinda introverted, yet it feels like most of that is because his glasses are doing most of the acting for him. He's able to play a fun variety of hit men, but that isn't really the central focus. Adria Arjona is pretty good at the love interest with what could best be described as innocently dark intentions.The jokes from many of the side characters didn't really work for me, most notably Gary's two police associates, played by Retta and Sanjay Rao. There seemed to be some kind of underlying message about how we're all capable of change in one way or another, but I feel like that was included to justify the surprisingly dark yet underwhelming ending this movie pulls.Overall, there's not much to say about Hit Man, aside from being an occasionally darkly humorous and empty movie that you'd put on when you don't want to think too hard.",

And the ending kinda took out all the good things (however much measly amount they were) away for sure. Because these things surely will give hope to someone that u can get away from a wrong doing and live happily ever after.As for acting, Glen really has the unreadable face with one or two expressions which worked in his favor in this movie. But Adria. You know those actresses in B or C grade movies where their acts immediately tell u they are fishy and acting and with no subtlety trying to pry information outta u and batting eyelashes to make u do something, her acting in this movie belongs in that category. Anytime she was on screen, i had to endure a fake performance.There was barely any action, any comedy and romantic romance, so defining which genre this one belongs to is hard.

Plus it is based loosely on a true story, which I usually find elevates my interest.That said, it isn't going to blow you away, doesn't do anything new and isn't particularly memorable. I can't fault the performances, and it is a fun enjoyable watch, which is worth viewing at home. I did get a bit of an insight into a whole 'world' of detective work that is legal and I was shocked by how scarily common it is for a spouse, or disgruntled friend/relation/colleague/rival to attempt to set up a hitman to kill.Having since read a bit about the guy upon whom this film's main character is based, his 'success' is undeniable. The parallel lives he led is impressive and fascinating. The statistics we are given on screen are accurate. But, it does become rather a farfetched plot and in some cases of 'based on true events' films I've really felt 'truth can be stranger/more wild than fiction '.However, in the case of Hitman, the twists and turns the story takes are fictional, and discovering this was slightly disappointing but I guess it also makes me feel they did a good job at using a true character and expanding/fleshing out an entertaining yarn!I'd love to see a documentary on this guy, and/or a different director/filmmakers create a more serious, exploration of him or other people who work undercover, and the impact this has upon their psyche, relationships, and the type of person who can actually live a life like this.",

This is what you'd come up with your friend, nothing over the top but still entertaining enough.While there's nothing GREAT about it, the writing and the chemistry between Glen and Adria sell the film well.

        "description": "\"The eternal mystery of human consciousness and behavior.\" Gary Johnson (Glen Powell)Having just enjoyed a summer stroll through an arts festival, I settled for another breezy summer evening with Glen Powell as a nerdy and hot professor and hitman, thanks to the Netflix trick of playing its crime soft and its romance, well, plainly romantic.Promising some truth in the telling, Hitman is based on a feature in Texas Monthly about Gary Johnson, a college philosophy teacher (see the above quote about his interest) who also moonlights with the local police as an ersatz hitman, nailing scores of bad apples looking to hire an assassin usually for reasons of love gone badly. Gary, wearing multiple disguises for his wildly different clients, can further enhance his lectures on the self: \"What if your self is a construct?\" he asks his students.Gary remains an operative who never kills anyone until he meets comely client, Maddy (Adria Arjona), and is drawn into a caper as Ron and lover, possibly becoming at least an accomplice to murder. Meanwhile, director Richard Linklater, who knows a thing or two about actors as lovers, weaves the romance with college lectures on identity and psychological self-styling, common threads in our social-media landscape. Our ability to create our own persona on Facebook or Snapchat, for example, is not unlike his profession, but not quite as dangerous, mostly.You don't need to know Nietzsche to believe that a mild-mannered professor could play a hit man (a student exclaims, \"When did our teacher get hot?\") or that anyone could construct a personality with the help of the Internet. The film becomes more than an amusing thriller as identities play a key role in furthering a promising romance or solving a crime that has murder as a centerpiece.Although more than once it's claimed there are no hitmen now or in history, Hit Man goes a long way in convincing us that they could be real. In more than one extended dialogue, Gary/Ron explains the complexity and allure of switching identities.Hit Man has its own double identity-cool summer caper and dangerous romance, both threatened by electronic surveillance and the human capability of shifting its persona throughout life. Although the subject of identity crafting involving the id, the ego, and the superego can't be adequately discussed in a brief TV melodrama, Hit Man does give one pause. And a brisk summer breeze.",

It simultaneously leads the audience effortlessly, from one plot point to the next all while throwing curve balls the whole way so we don't know where to look. Truly a fun ride to take.The acting is good on all fronts with special nod to Glen for having fun with multiple characters. Not much negative to discuss. Hit Man does drag a bit in the middle after starting strong but finishes even stronger. That is the key to rewatchability I think, a strong finish.

She had already done so with Gary, which caused him to freak out and give up his fake identity as 'Ron' the hitman. Quite honestly, I can't imagine how the guy was able to make with a comeback for every prospective client who was looking to have someone eliminated. The guy never said the wrong thing and had an answer for every eventuality. Talk about thinking on one's feet!So even though this picture might have been based on a true story, the whole thing had an air of incredulity about it. Getting back to the real Gary Johnson, he assisted in the arrests of more than 70 people seeking contract killers using aliases when it suited his purpose. The Madison Masters character was based on a woman that Johnson referred to social services and a therapist to get the help she needed to end an abusive relationship. When all was said and done, Gary Johnson never did kill anyone as a supposed contract killer, nor did Glen Powell's character, who probably would have missed if he had to pull the trigger.",

Linklater's latest lovingly pays homage to film noir, screwball comedy, Hitchcockian black comedy and even the good old psychosexual drama but it still somehow manages to conjure up a fresh, witty, and often uproarious confection that frequently teases, delights, and occasionally thrills the audience with frissons of excitement, keeping them enraptured all the way to its deliciously razor sharp ending. Go in blind - it's such a fun movie to experience with a crowd, knowing nothing of what's to come! I absolutely loved my experience watching this movie - it's a shame most people will experience it on Netflix for the first time. But because this movie is so unique and fun to experience knowing nothing about it - I'm gonna keep this short in order to preserve the experience of watching it for the first time! This film has been hyped up for months and yet it was still able to surpass everything I expected of it. This was some fresh, fun, effortless storytelling that works so well, and truly allows Glen Powell to ascend to a new level of movie stardom with such a charismatic performance! This is potentially a star-making turn for Glen Powell. Although he made a strong impression in Top Gun: Maverick as a cocky rival pilot, his role in Hit Man is easily more complex and, as the co-writer of the script, he has been able to add brilliant layers to his character, or should that be characters? His chemistry with the equally terrific Adria Arjona was dynamite, they both had true movie star energy! Both actors bring out the best in one another and it is thrilling! Hit Man is one of the most entertaining films of the year - a slick, cool, and hilarious crime film that deconstructs our notion of what a hitman is while simultaneously examining its lead character's ID, EGO, and SUPEREGO. This is Linklater at his most fun and effortless. A masterclass on direction, writing, and acting, Hit Man is a wild, entertaining ride that I can't wait to see many more times! I LOVED Hit Man, it left me with the biggest smile! It's a - hit, man!",

Glen Powell showed such diversity and intelligence in this role. He played a menagerie of people as an undercover hitman for the police department. He would pretend to be a hitman to expose people who had intent to have someone they know murdered. This was so well done.The scope of this plays from a psychological perspective and left me feeling light and fuzzy as our protagonist's relationship developed with our herione. This was such a playful bend on the stereotypical hitman movies that was so fun and different. Would definitely watch this again.",

        "description": "This movie has been so heavily talked up by some notable film critics no less that I was excited to give it a watch.The premise is simple enough. A philosophy professor moonlighting with a side gig assisting the NOLA Police Department who suddenly falls into the role of a lifetime when he fills in as a hit man for hire insn ongoing sting operation to thwart murder for hire plots. Much to everybody's surprise (himself included), it turns out he's really good at it.Along the way, he falls for a woman who initially comes to him to order a hit on her husband. Their chemistry unavoidable, he talks her out of it, they fall in love and then , in a sudden dark turn, she kills her husband. Yeah, she kills her husband.Rather than a moment of profound tonal shift into Coen Brotheresque neo-noir territory, the story continues apace along the same breezy pace before this shoulda been shocking event. There's no great reckoning. None. This would be weird for any character but for a philosophy professor with a deep regard for the moral clarity and ethics he espouses to his students in class all semester, it's particularly odd. Instead he lets it slide, comes clean with his love interest that he's really not a true hit man and in the process of participating in a murder to cover up the first murder effectively becomes the real thing.In more capable hands this could have been a classic slapdash 60s Cary Grant rom-com even with the unusual twist but it falls way short of anything especially comical or memorable. Like some of Linklater's other movies, there's a tonally flat quality that renders what should have been a really surprising transition little more than half baked and unnecessary. Whatever investment you've made in the characters feel like a waste.",

Powell plays Gary, a college professor of psychology and philosophy who moonlights, helping the police with electronic surveillance systems. When the main undercover cop is suspended, they ask Gary to step in. Now as Ron, he excels as a fake Hit Man and is asked by the police to get involved in many other set ups to catch out people looking to hire him to kill people. To do this he adopts disguises and identities to convincingly catch the targets out. One day though, looking to set up a young woman eager to kill her brutal husband, he falls for her and convinces her to back away. A romance begins which gets more and more complicated as he continues to play at being Ron.Fun stuff, which starts off as a straight comedy as he traps all sorts of eccentrics who want to kill husbands and wives etc. However, when the romance starts each scene ramps up the complications with the story becoming increasing dark and seemingly impossible for Gary to escape prison, get the girl etc. Powell is really good - truly now looking like a big star presence - looking at identity and whether it is possible to embrace a new one if required, in turn requiring him to play lots of different characters in order to catch the baddies. A good laugh, clever and worth seeing.",

They are:1) The audience should like your protagonists\n2) Have a good ending\"Hit Man\" breaks both rules. It pains me to say that, because 75% of the film I mostly enjoyed. I thought the leads acted well, good chemistry, etc.The film wasn't that funny, if it was trying to be a black comedy, which I \"think\" it was? But as a romantic film it was okay enough. Unfortunately the ending just wasn't well conceived.I thought the final act, as the cops closed in on Madison being a killer, was well set up. But the film decided to give Gary, the male lead, not only a different personality at the end of it all, but a completely different moral compass as well.I looked forward to the final scene between the protagonists, Gary and Madison, and their showdown with a dirty cop.Up to this point, Gary was portrayed as a likable enough guy who seemed to want to do the right thing, even if he occasionally bent the rules it was for the right reasons. Until, well until......Gary mysteriously transforms at the end of the film into a cold blooded cop killer. Who kills his colleague, in a completely blatant act. Just 180 degree turn in character. Was the sex \"that\" good?But besides being an out of character move, the twist makes the protagonists into negative characters, right at the end, so this becomes the lasting impression of them.Weirdly, I think the director frames the actions as strangely just, because Madison's husband \"might've been a jerk\", but this was never shown on screen. The murdered cop was also talked about as being a bad guy but he was never depicted as a bad guy on screen.So because we have to take the word of the characters that these people deserved to die, and that makes it okay?

The two leads are compelling attractive, but the quick-fire scenes used to build their on-screen romance felt tired and clichéd after the enjoyable run of scenes that preceded it, where we see Gary developing his hitman personas to suit his varied client base (with no shortage of intertextual references to other films with memorable killers).The movie picks up in the second half, culminating in one remorseless scene that brings together its themes and philosophy. It was enough to make up for the otherwise uncomfortable sense that the film was a slightly overlong apology for state-sanctioned murder and personal vigilante justice, disguised as a romantic comedy.I was left with the feeling that Hit Man could have been a much tighter, more engaging film if it was only about 25 minutes shorter.",

A psychology professor by profession, he also assists the New Orleans police department by going undercover. When another police who was tasked with going undercover as a fake hitman is suspended, Gary steps up to become Ron the hitman to catch the potential criminals who approach to hire him. What happens when Gary posing as Ron gets to meet a client and it's love at first sight? What trouble he gets into and how does he come out of the situation, forms rest of the story.Richard Linklater narrates this particular story which shifts gear when it comes to varied genres and it definitely helps to have a charming lead. Gary loves his job and is happy taking care of his pets so when he does get offered to go undercover, he gives his 100% to turn into a fake hit man and an ordinary professor turning into this charmer, is a transition well executed. The humor filled dialogues help ease out even when things seems to get serious. This is a genre that made me want some bigger twist in the final act but Richard chose to be loyal in narrating Gary's story or to say, not that predictable as I expected the story to be. Majority of the fun lies in those lines uttered not just by the lead actors and it's this smart balanced writing where the film wins big time.",

And wit! And Arjona was just as talented and gorgeous. While the performances were excellent and thoroughly enjoyable (also from Austin Amelio), the script gave them all something substantive to work with. It's not Shakespeare but it is so much better than the usual crappy, predictable writing with uni-dimensional characters and over-the-top villains. It was witty, it had twists and turns (some of which one can see coming but a few of which surprised me).

Her chemistry with Powell is electric from their very first encounter and she makes her character empathetic whilst adding a sense of mystery to her character as their relationship develops.Richard Linklater is on top form here with understated direction that plays to his strengths.

Despite being an hour and 55 minutes long, makes you invested in the detail put into the characters was just amazing...\nGlenn Powell, Retta, Austin Emilio, Adria Arjona, and so many more brought life into the movie. The twists and turns holds you until the end...\nEven though the movie is comedic, the life lesson behind it is meaningful & laughter leaves you think positively...Powell's character Gary and Adria Arjona's character Madison; these two were incredible on screen and really made this film enjoyable with their acting and how they are around each other as characters and as their normal person...The twist about an hour into this film is quite unexpected and is very good in setting up the second half of the film; leaving the audience wanting to keep watching, pulling them in to the film itself. The ending was impeccable as well; this film was extremely unpredictable and loved it. Amazing directing and producing from all workers that put their time into this film...Richard Linklater, who co-wrote the screenplay with Powell and directed the film, probably did as well as expected with the money and talent he had to work with. Linklater knows how to tell good film stories, and he does so here because he has a good feel for his source material...Overall \"Hitman\"has the meet-cute, aha moment, montage, grand gesture, cheesy lines, and is sexy as hell...",

        "description": "This movie could have been titled \" The hitman who isn't \" or \" A different kind of hitman \" and both would have been fine. Definitely a novel plot where a quintessential University Professor Gary Johnson ( Glen Powell) who teaches psychology/ philosophy and whose hobby is tinkering with electronics lands up as an undercover agent with the local police department. He has the dubious job of trapping desparados who are ready to pay hitmen like him to eliminate people. He does well, the cops like him but his infatuation for a pretty female client creates problems for him and the police department. Things get messy when a murder takes place, an investigation is ordered and he is a suspect too.Director Richard Linklater had impressed me in \" Boyhood \" but this tale of intrigue and crime is totally a different ball game as far as narratives go. Nevertheless it is a riveting plot and the situations get murkier as the storyline unfolds. Glen Powell is at ease with the changing hues of the character he plays. (Interesting to note that he has collaborated as the writer with Linklater.) The movie could be termed as a dark thriller with the protagonist in a twin personality of the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde type. Adria Arjona as the love interest and Austin Amelio as the colleague have given strong support.",

I don't know why people so fuss about it and asking about realism in comedy movies is pointless.The movie starts very great with a fast pace until Madison joins, it uses so much time to focus on the sex scene and unnecessary lecture scenes. I think they try to deliver the philosophy part or want to explain why or how characters develop in movies, which people already know. It just makes the story not go smoothly, it has Gary do his job and then come to have sex with Madison 3 times just to let us know that She has the knowledge to set up a murder from the after-sex talk. Rather than develop an antagonist story. So all we got from Jasper is a villain who lost his job because of himself and can't get back because of Gary. And U know what the final scene when Jasper is defeated they just add a sex scene for no reason. But overall it's pretty funny and that is the whole purpose. It would be better if they added music to the movie or had better background music that suits the scene the entire movie is so quite so we could have some memorable things but I guess this is what you're gonna get from a Netflix movie in the theater.",

Two things happen to derail this film. First the plot takes a sharp turn, and the film suddenly becomes a romantic comedy. Second the lead actress in said romance gives one of the worst performance that I have ever seen. It's like we are airlifted out of charming crime thriller and dropped into one of the most awkward second acts I have ever watched. I don't know who this actress is but she is awful. She tries to be cute and silly but her performance just took me right out of the movie. For some reason, she makes the decision to use her bulging eyes as an Italian actor might use their hands. It's bizarre. Also, she is a murderer. So why would are leading man fall for a bug-eyed psychopath? The film doesn't explain this at all. Suddenly they're married with kids, and this ending is not happy. It feels tragic, as both of them have covered up murders. In romantic comedies you either pull for a couple to get together or you don't. In this one, the moment this actress comes on the thinking Gary Johnston should run for the hills.",

        "description": "After thinking for a bit I've finally found a way to describe how this movie felt to me: once I went to a BBQ hosted by a friend that was incredible - great food, great company, great location. But at the end he stood up with a projector and pitched us on joining his pyramid scheme. Thats what this movie feels like - its a hell of a ride but when you get to the end you cant help but feel like all the good was made to soften the blow of the terrible ending. At the end you start to realize it's really an hour and a half or so of great fun that's written to convince you to overlook the moral and emotional objections you're bound to have when the movie's over. But it doesn't work. The objections linger. And as much as I wish I wasn't, I was dissatisfied.Above all else Hit Man is entertaining. Glen Powell shows off a surprising range playing not only Gary, but all of Gary's made-up versions of himself. He's somehow able to covey believable emotion as different characters and still win us over as he navigates the morally ambiguous world of undercover sting operations. I was also very impressed by Adria Arjona who could solicit a hitman and still feel innocent and could be so seductive without it feeling camp. I have a feeling we'll be hearing her name everywhere soon enough. Overall the chemistry was undeniable and these core performances made the movie as enjoyable as it was.But the issue: Gary's problem, according to his ex wife in the beginning of the film, is that he wont change. And to her that's unfortunate because he's passionless and nerdy and stiff. So, throughout the movie as we watch him change into Ron we hear him teach his students about morality and the psychology of the self, which eventually leads him to the conclusion that moral absolutes don't exist and persistent personalities don't either - we can change who we are, we can change right and wrong, its all just contructs anyways. So, in the end he becomes a tough guy and a murderer. And we're supposed to be happy for him.If my girlfriend told me \"you need to change\" and I came back the next day as a psychopath she wouldnt thank me. She'd say \"thats not what I meant.\" Because any conversation about whether we can change is not just about change for change's sake. That was never the question. Gary's problem in the beginning of the film was that he needed personal growth and by the end he still didn't have it. He went from a nerdy guy who was antisocial in a not-talkative way to a cool guy who is antisocial in a clinical way.If they made it tongue in cheek that he'd become a murderer I could see it being passable because its edgy. We could say its satire. But they don't do that. It feels like they really believe that Gary did the right thing in the end. They don't treat him like the subject of a character study. They give him the happily ever after treatment like a hero. He kills his coworker so he can keep going steady with his secret friend with benefits, who also just confessed to murder. And then he says \"yeah that guy was kinda racist and misogynistic\" so we feel less bad about it. And then it cuts to him telling his students \"there are no absolutes.\" The absolute frustration I felt at the end of this movie got me thinking absolutes do exist.All in all I admit I enjoyed most of the movie. My advice is to watch it and then towards the end just pause it and make up an ending for yourself (thats just a social contruct, right? As Gary would say). Then you can have a great time and avoid the feeling someone is secretly trying to convince you to become a villain.P.",

Adria Arjona is equally strong brining an unpredictable manic energy.The story is jam packed with numerous twists and turns. If you are only familiar with Richard Linklater from his tremendous 'before' trilogy, then you might be in for a surprise with the sheer amount of plot in Hit Man.

One day, he is selected to work in a series of undercover sting operations, getting wire-tapped confessions from those planning on arranging contract killings. But things take a misfiring turn, when he ends up falling for one of his assignments, in the shape of Madison (Adria Arjona), a young woman at the behest of her abusive ex, only for things to take a massive turn when crooked agent Jasper (Austin Amelio) gets in on their arrangement.There was a film from 1997 called Grosse Pointe Blank, that received some critical acclaim at the time despite a limit in much of the way of a wide release. Writer/director Richard Linklater's film would seem to owe much of its inspiration to this source, and seems to be another well received subversive take on the 'hitman' genre, spinning conventional wisdom of the standard tropes of films featuring these characters on their head at one point, with a colourful montage of past films from this genre, from some of the oldest ones to more modern stuff like 2008's In Bruges.Linklater's film seems a confusing jumble of genres, with elements of action, comedy and thriller thrown into the mix, but somehow keeps you engaged with everything that's going on, an original, engaging film, with its sly, wise-cracking script never letting up, and never letting the pace sag. It helps that the cast are all relatively unknown, and so no one overshadows the script or film in itself. That said, lead stars Powell and Arjona are perfectly up to the job, Powell curiously convincing as a man who can alternate between mild mannered lecturer and guy caught up in the criminal underworld, whilst Arjona is a sultry seductress who serves as a perfect foil to everyone's plans.It's an unsteady combination of different genres, and as a result it sometimes comes off weirdly, most notably with a morally iffy ending that could leave you feeling funny. But somehow, it all works, and you're left with one of the most original and worthwhile efforts in a while. ****",

There were so many plot holes and unbelievable situations that made this a bad movie, despite best efforts from everyone involved. From plot elements and settings from movies like \"Body Heat\", \"American Psycho\" and \"Twin Peaks\", I guess there was foreshadowing that in the end, we would are going to discover that the 2 main characters are just your typical garden variety psychopaths/murderers. The things that happen in the movie are unbelievable. The way Powell's character Gary starts to act once we find out what Madison really is doing is unbelievable. The movie completely falls apart when we find out the truth and the story becomes completely ridiculous at that point. Along with the silly \"The idea of You\", this movie and others being churned out have beautiful stars with great acting talent and sexy love scenes, but the scripts are stupid, poorly written and derivative. Cringed hard for the pilot fantasy scene. Hoping Powell's next movie will have a good script. The Brooke Shield's rom com was horrid as well - one of many terrible movies out there.

Arjona actually has a lot of charm and reminds me of Meghan Markle with a few brief flashes of Monroe.The plot is fine - although it all goes on too long and 40 minutes pass before we even see Arjona. However, after that it picks up and as the plot thickens I actually started to care about how they would get out of the mess they were in.And then we have three inexcusable errors:-1. Arjona apparently is the person who murdered her husband. This is a twist I didn't expect to see and although - sure - it does indeed make things more difficult and sets up an amusing scene where Powell has to silently coach Arjona what to say while they're being listened to by the cops on his wire, are we really supposed to give her a pass for murder? I mean, she's cute, but not that cute!2. In order to cover up the fact that she murdered her husband Powell then proceeds to murder in cold blood the (admittedly annoying) cop who's figured out the truth and is trying to shake them down for the insurance money.

THEY JUST LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER on the insurance payout from murdering her husband!Seriously, whoever thought it was acceptable to make a comedy where both the main characters commit murder and then live happily ever after with no retribution whatsoever is a disturbingly morally deficient individual.And then the movie production company approved this and it gets an 85 review score on Metacrtitic?Am I losing my mind here, or is there something seriously wrong with the society we're living in these days?2/10 because Arjona is cute.",

Glen Powell seems to be quite \"hot\" right now (which his students will say too, towards the end of the movie) - getting a writing credit next to Linklater here too.This may suggest it is action, but there is very little in that department happening. There is quite the romance going on and discussions ... a lot of dialog. And a lot happening too (cat and dog persons behave - it's a movie).

        "description": "In Richard Linklater's Hit Man, philosophy lecturer Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) ponders the question of how many people truly know themselves. The film tells the story of Johnson working for the New Orleans Police Department as a fake hit man for its sting operations. He is an amiable, Honda Civic-driving, bird-watching Everyman in shorts and glasses, who turns out to be the perfect fake assassin. Despite his unreadable face, Gary gets the gig at a moment's notice because the usual guy got caught beating up teens and got himself a 120-day suspension. However, Gary is a natural and convincingly transforms into a badass as soon as he meets his mark. This is similar to the scene in Collateral where Jamie Foxx's mousy cabbie has to pose as Tom Cruise's stone-cold assassin and suddenly becomes a new man. Glen Powell's performance in Hit Man might make him a movie-star because it is at heart a fantasy. Gary plays a figure out of our collective imagination, playing a figure out of our collective imagination. He researches his clients beforehand and tailors his look for their expectations of a hit man, making up the character as he sees fit. He meets Madison (Adria Arjona), a terrified wife being tormented by an unstable, domineering husband. She tries to hire Gary, but he slyly convinces her to give up on the idea because he doesn't want her going to prison. They fall in love, but she thinks he's still \"Ron,\" the grizzled, open-collared killer who showed her some genuine compassion and impromptu life coaching. Gary also thinks he's Ron, or at least becomes Ron whenever he's with her, so much so that he's now a demon in bed. He has the instincts of a tougher guy when they're together, and when Madison's estranged husband spots them at a club and threatens them, Gary immediately pulls out a gun, Clint Eastwood-style, and backs him off. Hit Man is a film that deconstructs the concept of stardom by presenting a character we cannot be, and then making us believe we can be him. The film's amiable filmmaking and Powell's charming, self-aware swagger are infused with the idea that anything is possible, making the world seem open, malleable, and accepting. The auteur theory has been criticized for its lack of focus on the material, but Linklater's breeziness and generosity as a director work wonders in this film. It serves as a rebuke to other hit-man movies at Venice this year, such as David Fincher's The Killer and Harmony Korine's Aggro Dr1ft. Linklater's film feels genuinely fresh, with fun for the star and the audience. The film's overt philosophical digressions, such as Gary's lectures to his classes, are easygoing and lively. Linklater's gentle touch is his secret weapon, and Hit Man might be a masterpiece. The film's overt philosophical digressions, in the form of Gary's lectures to his classes, are equally easygoing and lively.",

        "description": "After passing through various festivals and having the presence of one of the great contemporary directors, Hit Man was preceded by a great reception and the truth is that it is confirmed once we see what will surely be among the best films of the year when we make the final count.A highly professional director like Richard Linklater is possibly the great secret weapon for making this film work the way it does, taking into account that in other hands it will most likely not have the same satisfaction that one gets. A director who has known how to provide great black comedies, once again achieves the task of satisfying us as viewers with an intelligent, well-thought-out and very well-structured film, which in turn leads you to immediately connect with a story that seems to be going too slowly, but That, just like its protagonist, makes an immediate click and we don't realize how deeply we are immersed in a plot that captivates us as each dialogue passes.Also for everything to work perfectly we need effective protagonists and Glen Powell shows everyone that he is an actor who is efficiently reaping his current moment of recognition, beyond the physical appearance, he is also a very good actor and Here we can see it in all its dimension and in all its aspects that allow it to shine from beginning to end. In that same place we can leave Adria Arjona, who possibly gives one of her strongest performances to date, complementing herself and sharing her level with her co-star without having to reproach an actress who is on the rise. Two incredibly well-written and very well-acted characters with whom it is impossible not to have a connection with them.It is such an intelligent film that hides behind its title all the deception that its characters possess, it is a clever and hilarious comedy that incredibly in its dialogues hides the best weapon to provide you with the most absolute entertainment so far this year. We are left with a sexy and ingenious proposal that is positioned as an entertaining proposal beyond the explosions and chases. A captivating comedy that dares to narratively go beyond the commonplaces that logic might presume. The Linklater style is more than present in the one that also elevates a new Hollywood star like Glen Powell.A satisfactory film in all its aspects that crosses different genres without clashing in any of them and allowing itself to establish itself as one of the most refreshing proposals so far in 2024. It deserves to be seen and enjoyed and to indulge in the fun of an original proposal , conquering, exciting and perfectly achieved.",

Glen Powell is basically perfect in this role and I loved still managing to feel invested in his journey despite becoming more and more conflicted by the actions that he takes. As a crime thriller it's totally effective and as a dark comedy it's utterly hilarious.

He has also worked part-time with the New Orleans Police Department as a technical advisor on some undercover operations. Suddenly, Jasper (Austin Amelio), the guy who usually plays the undercover role of a hitman, is suspended, and Claudette (Retta) and Phil (Sanjay Rao) co-opt Gary to fill in. Gary proves amazingly skilled at his job with his forgettable face, many disguises, and believable sales pitch. Nonetheless, Gary's ex-wife (Molly Bernard) encourages him to liven up his personality.Suddenly, Gary meets Madeline Masters (Adria Arjona), a beautiful young woman who wants to have her husband, Ray (Evan Holtzman), killed. Rather than trap her, Gary encourages her to flee her husband and begin her own life. Soon, Gary and Maddy begin a relationship in which she still believes Gary is a hitman, and Gary's police colleagues are unaware of his relationship with a potential suspect. The movie then unfolds through many twists and turns that threaten their relationship and their trust in one another.\"Hit Man\" is a supremely clever story loosely based on a real Gary Johnson in Houston. It has a romantic comedy edge against a film noir backdrop. Powell and Arjona have excellent chemistry. The script lags a little in the middle but sprints to the end and has a good film noir ending.",

Of course just looking at her it is pretty easy to do so, Spoilers ahead: Do they end up together? Yes they do ( although people get killed like her abusive husband and a crooked cop). I am a huge fan of the ending where they are married with children ( and still in love with each other). Why? I despise ambiguous endings.

Gary's unique talent for adopting various guises and personalities enables him to trap those who wish to eliminate someone. However, his professional and ethical boundaries came to blur when he was contacted by Madison, played by Adria Arjona, to hire him to kill her husband. As Madison falls for one of Gary's personas---the sexy Ron---their steamy relationship ignites a series of play-acting, deception, and escalating stakes.The most effective aspect of the movie lies in the moral and psychological dilemma faced by the protagonist, Gary. As a professor, he teaches ethical principles promotes clear-cut notions of right and wrong, and identifies yourself. Yet, his secret activities forced him to navigate a morally ambiguous persona, creating a stark contrast between his personal and professional undercover work. This contradiction sets the stage for profoundly exploring his identity and ego. Gary's struggle to separate his true self from the various personas he adopts adds another layer to his characterization. This internal conflict is vividly shown, making viewers think about what really shapes our identity and how it changes based on the different roles we play in life and the different people we interact with.The main concept of the movie is the five-factor model of personality--- extraversion, neuroticism, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. This framework created another layer to the main character's emotional depth. Throughout the film, Gary has presented different types of personas and it begs the question as to where amongst the five factors does his personality change belong. This idea isn't just interesting but also makes the story deeper, offering a lot to think about for anyone curious about psychology and how characters develop. It makes you wonder about how flexible our identities can be and how outside events shape who we are, adding a unique psychological twist to the movie.The screenplay is also one of the movie's greatest strengths. Co-written by Richard Linklater and Powell, the movie serves as a masterclass in the simplicity and ingenuity of the script. In general, movies don't have to rely heavily on grand and over-the-top dramatic twists, and this is where \"Hit Man\" excels. The screenplay focuses on the nuanced character development and clever plot turns that allow the audience to be continually engaged. The writing in this movie is very tight, witty, and full of subtle surprises, despite having some pacing issues in the first two acts, the movie's clever script and engaging dialogues make it compelling and fun to watch. Powell's involvement in the screenplay is a pleasant surprise for me as well, this showcases his versatility beyond acting and proving his capability as a writer.Glen Powell's performance is nothing short of a revelation. To be honest, one of my worries in this movie is Glen Powell, I fear that he might just be another boy next door, potentially making his performance less convincing. However, Powell dispels these doubts with his multifaceted portrayal of Gary and his various personas. His ability to seamlessly transition from one character to another, each with its own unique charm and complexity, is genuinely impressive. The chemistry between Powell and Arjona adds another layer of intensity and sensuality to the film. Their dynamic as actors embodies a dark and romantic comedy vibe that fits well within the neo-noir genre which allows the narrative to be very enriching and emotionally deep.Despite its strength, the movie is far from perfect. The pacing in the first and second acts can feel sluggish, as the narrative takes its time to build up Gary's undercover exploits. This slow and gradual build-up can be very overwhelming to some viewers, making you question the direction of the story and where it's heading. The film spends a considerable amount of time establishing Gary's various personas, and in the 2nd half, the relationship buildup between Gary and Madison is overtly done. However, as the movie progresses and once we've reached the 3rd act, the movie brings clarity and resolution, tying together the movie's themes and character arcs in a satisfying conclusion. At 1 hour and 50 minutes, the movie could have benefited from tighter editing to maintain a more consistent pace and keep the audience more engaged throughout.Overall, \"Hit Man\" has all the elements of a perfect film-smart writing, good performances, and an unusual Bonnie and Clyde love story. The writing is clever, simple, and with the right amount of twists that work seamlessly with the material. It stands out as a crowd-pleasing addition to the neo-noir genre and is a testament to Richard Linklater's skillful storytelling. Despite its pacing issues, the film ultimately delivers a compelling narrative that resonates with audiences. Glen Powell's performance and the clever exploration of identity make \"Hit Man\" a memorable and thought-provoking cinematic experience. The film's visual style is another standout feature, with Linklater's keen eye for detail creating a world that feels both grounded and surreal. The New Orleans setting provides a rich, atmospheric backdrop that complements the film's themes of deception and identity. The cinematography captures the city's moody, noir-esque ambiance, adding another layer of depth to the narrative.In true Richard Linklater fashion, \"Hit Man\" is a home run, solidifying its place in his impressive filmography. The film's unique blend of psychological depth, moral ambiguity, and romantic intrigue makes it a standout in the neo-noir genre, offering a narrative that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally engaging.In conclusion, \"Hit Man\" is a film that succeeds on multiple levels. It is a smart, engaging, and thought-provoking addition to the genre, with strong performances, a compelling narrative, and a unique exploration of identity and morality. Richard Linklater and Glen Powell have created a film that is both entertaining and intellectually stimulating, proving that the neo-noir genre still has plenty of room for innovation. Whether you're a fan of Linklater's previous work or new to his filmography, \"Hit Man\" is a film that is sure to leave a lasting impression.",

        "description": "Directed and written by Richard Linklater. A runtime of one hour and fifty-five minutes. Streaming on Netflix with an R rating.\"Gary Johnson,\" played by Glen Powell, is a bit of a loner. He's a professor teaching general psychology, but in his spare time, he works with the local police force. Doing of all things being a fake hitman.It didn't always start that way. At first, he only worked on the technical side of things. Working with \"Phil,\" played by Sanjay Rao, \"Claudette,\" played by Retta, and \"Jasper,\" played by Austin Amelio. \"Jasper\" who you might remember from playing \"Dwight\" in \"The Walking Dead\" was the head undercover officer playing a hitman.When \"Jasper,\" who is a scumbag, got suspended, they needed someone on the fly to help. \"Gary\" was forced on the spot to fill in for \"Jasper.\" A decision that affected his life forever.Being better than even \"Jasper\" was, which was a shock to everyone. Plus he wasn't a cop officially. \"Gary\" used elaborate disguises and could somehow tap into the head of the person who was trying to order a hit. Getting many people arrested and saving a lot of lives.But a woman named \"Madison,\" played by Adria Arjona, who was looking for \"Gary's\" services, threw a monkey wrench into the op. Now being clouded by beauty and getting lost in disguise. \"Gary\" is going to be forced to make a lot of difficult decisions and be tempted to lead a stray. In this surprisingly based on a true story film.\"Hit Man\" was another home run by Glen Powell. Who was also a producer, helped create the story, and was involved with this film from top to bottom. This was his baby, and he did a great job with it.The acting was great, and the story was so intriguing. A lot of films I've watched recently have been so entertaining, partly because they are derived from true events. It just makes things better when you think about how this happened.Unfortunately, the real Gary Johnson passed away. He was an intriguing man who had a true calling, I can't lie. Some stuff was dramatized, but a lot was real. It's fascinating. He should be cheered for all the lives he saved.Glen Powell is on a heater, and he has another potential smash coming our way next month in \"Twisters.\" Let's see if he can keep shooting at this clip. Anyway, this was a fun film that was entertaining and frustrated you at times. But all in a good way. I give this film five mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin\n#CosmoMovieBlog\n#CosmoLanier\n#HitMan.",

        "description": "I totally I wasn't drawn to this movie, but devoid of anything else to watch on Netflix I gave it a punt. So glad I did. The actors all did a fantastic job, the script was sharp, well written and didn't distract from the plot. There was a lot of spark between the characters, backed up by no over-padding back stories, they just laid it out there and enjoyed the ride. I wouldn't go so far as to call it an out and out comedy, but it was humourous in an intelligent way. There was a certain amount of predictability but I also caught myself being denied some leading assumptions. If I were to be critical in any way it would be that the pacing at the beginning was a little laboured, we really didn't need to see all those perps being stung and the personalities of the main character, but I understand why the writer felt the need to embed his chameleon-like persona. I do think it could have gotten away with being a bit darker, and the ending was a bit too sugar-coated for me - more akin to a rom-con, and it could have again, gotten away with being more of a thriller/noir type movie, with a bit more of a twist at the end. But overall, very watchable and entertaining, a breath of fresh air in the (English) Netflix catalogue.",

        "description": "Well, I'll admit I wasn't a fan of either Glen Powell or Adria Arjona up until right now. Richard Linklater, one of the most captivating writer-directors of our times, is the guy behind that (sudden) change of perspective. He brings them together in such a fun, quirky little rom-com that takes advantage of their sizzling chemsitry. Like, wow. I didn't think Powell could actually take on a role with not one, but two personas embedded within. Arjona is too darn hot, and I like her even more when she moves as good as she speaks. And then, there are the signature Linklater dialogues on life's little pleasures, and random stuff like the cosmos, fish, signing contracts, pies, slicing fingertips, and whatnot. Gosh, not many can treat ARTICULATION like the sexy skill it is.. King Richard Linklater and his intriguing philosophies, I'm forever SOLD!The humor in the film is candid, subtle, and situational. There are some great puns and parallels drawn, with dialogues doing a lot of the work. What stops me from rating this any higher is the rather convenient ending (which I kinda foresaw) and it lacked the element of surprise that the rest of the film was nearly able to pull off. But for what it's worth, this once again proves that two actors who are better known for their physical appearance, can in the hands of a great director, impress you with their performances. The foreplay/sex scenes in the film are magnificently executed, and you'll almost feel the HEAT occupying the entire room. To think this was the exact opposite I felt when I saw Glen Powell & Sydney Sweeney together in Anyone But You.. speaks volumes!P. S. Full marks for the Patrick Bateman reference.",

        "description": "Hold onto your hats, folks, because \"Hit Man\" (2023) is the rollicking, riotous ride we didn't know we needed! Glen Powell takes the lead as the most lovable fake hitman this side of the silver screen, delivering one-liners and dodging bullets with a roguish wink that's bound to steal hearts and illicit chuckles. His partner in crime, Adria Arjona, holds her own with snark and sass, making this dynamic duo an absolute delight to watch. Their back-and-forth banter crackles with such electric chemistry, you'd think they were trying to out-charm each other in every scene.Plot-wise, imagine a blender filled with action, comedy, and a sprinkle of absurdity-and then imagine it explodes. That's this movie. It's a wild mash-up of genres that dances dangerously close to the edge of ridiculousness without ever tumbling over. Each plot twist is more surprising than the last, serving up a deliciously unpredictable narrative that keeps you guessing whether you're still watching a comedy or if you've stumbled into a thriller by mistake. The action sequences? Think ballet with bullets. It's so over-the-top that you can't help but applaud the audacity.So, why does this cinematic carnival ride earn a solid 4.5 stars? Well, it's simple: it's damn entertaining. Sure, it flirts with chaos, and maybe one too many jokes doesn't land perfectly, but who cares when you're having this much fun? \"Hit Arnold\" is a film that doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you. Pop some popcorn, suspend your disbelief, and prepare to be thoroughly amused. Just when you think you've seen it all, \"Hit Man\" winks and says, \"Hold my beer.\"",

He consults on a police undercover team that targets clients hiring assassins. One day, the official undercover detective (Jasper) is suspended just as the team are onsite waiting to meet a 'client'.Gary is sent in and has to improvise. Surprisingly, mild Gary becomes a chameleon (Ron the hitman). Morphing into a variety of hitman characters that the clients trust. Incriminating the clients who are arrested after they hand over a down-payment.One 'client' is a pretty wife (Madison) that wants to have her abusive husband killed. Gallantly, Gary/Ron sends her on the way with advice to leave her husband (Ray). Unfortunately, Gary is smitten by this winsome woman. Foolishly, he follows up on Madison on his own time.The scheming Madison seduces Gary because she believes that he is Ron, a genuine killer. Learns how to murder Ray from her unsuspecting lover.To Gary's horror, Ray is shot to death. Suspicion falls on Madison because of a million dollar insurance policy. That's why the scheming Madison doesn't just divorce her husband. She also wants a payday after ditching her husband.At this point, anything could have happened. Had Gary come clean and helped trap Madison, Gary would have remained the mild psychology professor. Instead, Gary becomes an accomplice by shielding Madison. Helping her deceive the police.Then, there is the complication when Jasper (the undercover detective) gets greedy. Extorts the couple for the million door insurance policy. The psychopathic Madison drugs Jasper, and Gary chooses to suffocate Jasper. Using his experience to make it seem like a suicide.The deception works. Gary and Madison escape detection. Get married and have children. Somehow, the accomplices live happily after.There was the possibility of other outcomes Madison could have ditched Gary after getting her payday. Possibly, Madison stayed with Gary because he turned out to be a real life Ron (the bad boy).After all the criminality, Gary becomes more confident. Was there always a Ron hiding in Gary?The movie maker has cleverly posed the question. Who are we? Can we become the characters we play? Or, will the real person emerge under the right circumstances?Based on a real life character in Texas who helped entrap 60 clients looking to hire an assassin.IMO, the film would have been stronger with a better script. More tenson between Gary/Ron and Madison. The murderers turning on each other before reconciling.",

The film is based off a true story and centers around a quirky college professor named Gary who works part time for law enforcement playing a fake hitman to entrap and arrest those attempting to seek one out.The movie has plenty of jokes to go around and when the cop who primarily portrayed the fake hitman loses his thunder to Gary, the quirky college professor delves even more further into the job creating disguises and personas even quirkier than himself. It is upon meeting a beautiful damsel in distress named Madison that Gary creates a suave and friendly hitman persona named \"Ron\" that a fireworks of chemistry ensue between them.This is when the film hits its stride as Gary becomes more like \"Ron\" as the movie progresses until he essentially becomes this persona especially towards the dark ending when someone does end up dead and Madison is linked to it.I'm not against dark endings but this one felt a bit strange in that things go from dark and then happy go lucky so quickly you can't help but feel slightly disturbed instead of happy for Gary.Overall, a solid Linklater film that is funny with great dialogue that really shines due to Glen Powell and Adria Arjona's performances.",

        "description": "In 'inspired by truth' comic thriller \"Hit Man\" nerdy New Orleans college professor Glen Powell (fast rising star for good reason) helps out the po-po (Austin Amelio, Retta, & Sanjay Rao) with sting op surveillance gear - leading him to step into said ops (in various amusing guises) as a fake hitman for hire. But when he becomes involved with target Adria Arjona (femme fatale?) who wants her mean hubbie dead, events start to twist & turn. Films combining genre themes often flop, but esteemed director Richard Linklater pulls it off here, strongly aided by Powell as his excellent co-writer. With a little bit of everything \"Hit Man\" is terrifically entertaining & engaging.",

In order to cover up the fact that she murdered her husband Powell then proceeds to murder in cold blood the (admittedly annoying) copy who's figured out the truth and is trying to shake them down for the insurance money.

It is definitely one of the best scripts I've seen a netflix film has - the fact it was coming from netflix was probably why I wasn't expecting much.The film starts off a little slow, but things pick up when Madison is introduced. This is what makes the film for me, the chemistry between the two leads Gary and Madison. Their characters are written greatly, but the best thing is the actors performance. With no suprise, Glen Powell is the star of the show and brings the character, and the whole movie, to life.Watching the sexy, twisted, layered relationship between the two invests you in the movie as it develops. It may be a little predictable what will happen in a few parts, but it grips you right until the end.The end is pretty solid. It really wasn't what I was expecting and leaves you thinking about it.Overall, hit man really is a hit with great performances, chemistry between the cast, great writing, mostly great pacing. It's fun, enjoyable and sexy, while also twisted and gripping.",

        "date": "10 June 2024",
        "description": "In a lot of ways, \"Hit Man\" was a true-romance story instead of a true-crime one. It featured a so-called notorious undercover hitman who fell in love when least expected, thereby establishing a macabre rom-com undertone that was thoroughly entertaining.Imagine being mistaken for a good guy when you're working as a professional killer-for-hire, but only pretending to do so on the police's behalf, and in New Orleans to boot.That's what happened to Gary Johnson, who was played to outstanding effect by Glen Powell, who was casually funny, intense when needed, and charming otherwise. He was a psychology professor whose skills the police needed to cinch certain criminals, but then he got deep into the heart of things and lost his way; or rather, found a new one.The message at the heart of \"Hit Man\" became clear when Gary broke his own rules to help one of the contract-killer hirers - Madison Figueroa Masters (played engagingly by Adria Arjona) - escape her abusive husband Ray Masters (played notably by Evan Holtzman).There was a predictable twist connected to her character, but nothing so bad as to ruin the plot. A feel-good story coupled with rom-com vibes thus unfolded, with a generous helping of intrigue and humour.\"Hit Man\" 2024 contained a wealth of pleasant surprises. For starters, it felt like the story tapped into the ever-high demand for murder-misadventure tales and gave it a romantic twist, with an undercover civilian pretending to play a cut-throat character to bust various criminal endeavours.The movie also had a welcome 80s vibe. But what I genuinely admired about it was the fact that it was all based on a true story, and a very real Gary Johnson who worked as a college instructor (psychology and philosophy) by day and moonlighted as an undercover hitman for the New Orleans police.Sanjay Rao (as Phil), Retta (as Claude), Austin Amelio (as Jasper), and Gralen Bryant Banks (as Sergeant Hank) did good work as the NOPD crew. Molly Bernard (as Alicia; Gary's civilian ex) gave a memorable performance as well.As for the wide-ranging list of contract-killer hirers, Mike Markoff (as Craig), Bryant Carroll (as Walt), Martin Bats Bradford (as Isaac), Jo-Ann Robinson (as a posh woman), Jonas Lerway (as Monte), Kate Adair (as Rita), Morgana Shaw (as Tammi), Ritchie Montgomery (as Marcus), and Richard Robichaux (as Joe) were all caricatured down to a T but nonetheless gave engaging (though brief) performances. According to Press reports, the real Gary Johnson died - 1947-2022. Obvious conspiracy theories notwithstanding, \"Hit Man\" was a careful nod to one of the shadiest professions still in existence today; don't let some of the dialogues in this movie make you believe otherwise.The plot also insinuated that even in the coldest of hearts, there might be the need to go good and help the innocent. But don't go trusting your friendly community killer after reading that line. Not all of them are keen on being as nice as Gary Johnson was, and he was the goddamned police (irony-sarcasm intended).The movie ended on a dark note, rife with psychological subtext but no real-life parallels. The OG Gary Johnson was, apparently, the \"chilliest dude imaginable\". There were also some interesting noir-movie easter eggs worth appreciating.\"Hit Man\" was one of the few movies to surprise me this year. For a story based on grim true-crime cases, its protagonist came across as skillfull, heroic, and entertaining in all the right ways. Such characterisation balance was genuinely admirable.\"All pie is good pie.\"--- --- ---\nSpecial shout-out to Kim Baptiste (as a defence lawyer), John Raley (as a defence lawyer), Jordan Salloum (as Ray's friend), Stephanie Hong (as Mindy), Joel Griffin (as Peter), KC Simms (as Jerren), and Murphee Bloom (as Gwen).",

        "description": "I need help in getting back the hour (nearly 2, mind you, but felt like 3) I wasted. The real tragedy here is its popularity and hype. Sad that these actors are considered rising stars from this absolute dumpster fire.The start was actually promising. I was genuinely enjoying it and really thought I'd like Glenn Powell or whatever his name is. I'd never even heard of him before this but yikes, my hopes came down crashing and burning like all my expectations in men do. What on Earth was this? His acting is okay at best. Not great, but good enough to watch, but that's really it. The multiple disguises he did...eh, I didn't buy it. How did none of the people he hired find him suspicious? The Russian accent was so over the top, it was like he was cosplaying. Anyway, 50 minutes into the movie and nothing, and I mean NOTHING was happening. Just a montage of him going through different disguises. Seriously, what is this movie supposed to be? A comedy? Well, no, it wasn't funny. A romance? There wasn't much of a romance, just a whole bunch of making out and sex so it was more of an erotica. I sensed no chemistry for it, by the way, so that wasn't very believable either. Just made for awkward kink scenes. Instead of exploring the dilemma of Gary having to follow his morals and choosing justice over a woman he's falling in love with (which would have made for a more suspenseful movie), he turns into a murderer for a woman he just met and swaps his cats for dogs for her. It was giving hard simp energy. Gag me now. Aren't we supposed to like the leads in a movie?Also, how is Gary so comfortable and confident that very first time he had to fake being a hitman? It doesn't make sense. There's no internal or external struggle or anything outside of his teaching job that shows us that he's comfortable in switching personalities. We're supposed to be engaged with him, worry for him and fear for him fricking up his first mission. Now that would have been fun to see, especially him growing as a character. It falls flat because he almost seems too perfect at it. Just because he's seen other cops do it doesn't mean he can do the same. That's like saying I've helped around on movie sets and seen people act for years so that must mean I can act.I'm even more surprised by the positive reviews that seem to be slapped across my face everywhere. These people must either be paid or they just like jumping on the band wagon of anything that Hollywood critics claim is 'good', which by now I know to believe the exact opposite.The moral message of this movie is messed up and kinda evil. Because there is no morals. The only message that stands out to me is that murder is okay because love prevails. A bucket load of horse dung if you ask me.Gary is smitten the moment he sees the FL (I forgot her name lol oops). She tries to justify her desire to see him dead because he is bad, but this is never shown. She wants to kill him because...uh, he didn't like her wearing miniskirts? Oh no, what a piece of unworthy trash! It wasn't like she was in an abusive relationship because she literally just ups and leaves him. If it was that easy, why wasn't that her first move? She really needed some random hit man to tell her that for her to leave him. Isn't she an adult? That pretty much confirms her character: psychopath.Gary, as Ron, supports her despite him being shown as this sweet guy who is always on the right side of the law. Why? Because he's having sex with a woman that looks like a supermodel and he prolly wouldn't ever get a woman like that under normal circumstances as Gary. I understood why his ex wife left him, not because he refused to change but because he's lowkey pathetic. He saw the red flags and just decided to ignore them but boy, these weren't just red flags. These were blatant red sirens. She lied to him about getting divorced and lied to him about killing someone. I'm supposed to believe it'll end happily between them regardless of whether they have kids or not? Who's to say he won't end up like her ex? Does he find that hot? None of it made SENSE.We're also told Jasper is a jerk and sure, he's annoying and had an ulterior motive but he didn't deserve to die! When Jasper dies in front of them, Gary was shocked for only two minutes. He was strangely more calm about it. For someone who'd never seen a dead body before you'd think he'd react badly. He goes on to label Jasper as a racist, a misogynist to excuse the murder--the movie never shows Jasper as either of those so Gary literally had no qualms about slandering a poor dead dude to fit their convenience. To top it off, bro proceeds to make out/have sex with her despite there being a dead body right in front of them. Is this supposed to be funny? Sexy? No, it was vile. So really he's a murderous psychopath too, but we never get an indication of his fragile mental state tittering on the edge of snapping before all this. There is no mention of any sort of dissociative disorder either (which would have made a little more sense) so...he's throwing away any semblance of who he is as a person and his values for a stranger.Gary is clearly turned on by all this because he ends up dropping the L bomb at the end. I understand she's beautiful, but really? They don't even know each other or have anything in common, except for the fact that they're both insane. All the moments where they could have tried to make it into a good romcom is made meaningless by a script full of sex, boring dialogue and lacklustre acting. But I guess Hollywood relies on all that to keep the attention of hormonal teenagers---and to cover up the fact that there is literally no plot.This is the kind of rubbish Hollywood is throwing out there. Hard pass. If there is anyone telling you this is an amazing movie, just run.",

The audience then has to be as dumb as the other cops in accepting Jasper's suicide cover-up. (What? No autopsy finding the drugs she gave? And what drugs?

        "description": "I always look forward to the films of Richard Linklater, whom I consider one of the most interesting American filmmakers. His films manage to bring to the screens novel landscapes of American reality and characters that involve their viewers. His persistence in long-term projects has managed to transform time perspectives that span many years and decades into plots and images. Linklater is constantly looking for new characters to turn into stories on screen and new forms of expression to tell their stories. However, not all of his experiments are successful to my taste. This is also the case with 'Hit Man', an original combination which, however, failed to convince me.'Hit Man' is inspired by a real-life character named Gary Johnson, who lived in Houston and assisted the local police as an undercover agent, posing as a professional killer to those looking to buy assassination services and gathering evidence (mostly taped recordings of conversations) to arrest and prosecute them for planning murders. The script moves the action to New Orleans and assigns Gary the job of art teacher, showing him giving moral and life lessons to his young students. As long as he builds the character of the teacher who masquerades as different variants of professional killers, adapting his physiognomy and attitude to the 'clients', the film is interesting and funny. When the romantic component is added, it becomes less believable, not to mention the moral and legal ambiguities. What doesn't work? To a large extent, the role and activities of the police assistant hero are based on the first impression, or if you want, on the prejudices through which people judge those around them. The police disguises may fool the buyers of crime services, but the identity game on which the romantic story is based is more difficult to believe. A relationship based on false identities has no chance of standing the test of time. Or maybe the script wants to tell us that true love can overcome even lies about identity? Such a message is too trivial to support the surprises in the second part of the film. Linklater uses tools from the film noir toolkit mixed with romantic comedies and a little eroticism, but the combination just didn't work for me.Glen Powell is a good actor, but what he does in this movie constantly reminded me of Ryan Gosling and in cases like this I prefer the original. His romantic partner is played by Adria Arjona, who looks fantastic but whom I need to see in other roles to convince myself of her acting qualities. 'Hit Man' is a movie that many will like, OK as entertainment, but I found it to be one of Richard Linklater's weaker movies. In my opinion, this is one of the highly overrated movies of this season.",

The much lauded \"chemistry\" between the two leads was either pushed by the studio or the result of the female lead acting as if she was on the verge of orgasm for most of her screen time. The movie is undeniably well made, the leads are enormously attractive, and there a few chuckles. The scene with the cellphone texts tipping off the female leads as the cops listened was amusing for sure. The female detective was great throughout - great comedic timing. But this is definitely a wait-until-its-free-on-your-favorite-streaming-channel kind of film. You'll be pleasantly entertained.Spoiler: how are you supposed to root for the couple after they kill the detective in a most horrific way, the detective being only character smart enough to see through them? Was he supposed to be the bad guy instead of the actual two-time killer because he is made to appear unattractive and she is....pretty?Would have been better with a little more Double Indemnity, a little less Hart to Hart.",

If that is the case he nailed it because I have no idea if this was a rom-com (laughed about two times in this movie), a thriller that didn't really have a climax... can that even be called a thriller?? The characters are inconsistent and I was always guessing if they were genuine or not. It is not all bad, the acting is good, the dialogue was okay in parts, I liked the chemistry between the two, but there are too many dropped plot threads and inconsistent tones to actually enjoy the movie.Am I supposed to like the characters at the end of this or hate them?

Unfortunately, we were disappointed on every level. The story and acting both reflected a self-consciousness that was distracting and off-putting. The creative team may have had fun conceiving and executing this project, but rather than getting pulled in by a clever and entertaining story, we were left with the sense that they wanted us, the viewers, to be impressed with their cleverness and cool. It felt like being in the presence of a person that not only thinks they are the smartest person in the room, but are determined to let us know how smart they are. The film's subject appears to be that we need to actively endeavor to be the people we want to be, but that ostensible message rang hollow due to the self regard which permeated both the storytelling and performances. In the end, this felt like more of an exercise in style with very little substance, which in part may reflect a shift in focus due to the creative team's decision to take a real person and story and embroider fictional subplots onto it that felt hollow and thin emotionally.",

Like most people, I like Glen Powell, thought the idea for it sounded cool, and saw all the positive reviews. It starts off terrific, as the scene with Glen's Gary Johnson a.k.a. Ron taking down his first mark is fantastic.After that, zzzz.....What follows is a montage of similar scenes, as a bunch of poor rednecks - who somehow have thousands of dollars in cash laying around to hire a hit man - get taken in by Gary/Ron. It is also fairly obvious what the producers are telling us by making all of them white people with southern accents.Then a gorgeous Mexican-American woman tells him her husband is abusing her and he sympathizes with her and tells her to keep her money and they start an affair. There is never any evidence that her husband is abusing her. Yeah they bump into him and he's kind of a jerk, but that shouldn't warrant a death sentence.The writers try to give us a third-act twist but most viewers will see it coming a mile away. Then - no spoilers since it's in the trailer - she kills her husband after tweaking his life insurance policy to increase its payout. She doesn't get revealed to be some femme fatale with some Machiavellian plot. She just killed her husband, who may or may not have been abusing her. Then Gary/Ron does something to help her get away with it. That's it. That's the movie.It's been a while since I was this disappointed with a movie or show that I thought was going to be good.If you read this review before watching the movie and still decide to give it try, here's what might happen: You'll be about halfway through and bored out of your mind and thinking about stopping, but you might think that it might pick up and get better. It won't. Turn it off, you won't miss anything.

Directed by Richard Linklater, a name usually associated with thought-provoking dramas, this film feels like a misfire from start to finish.Glen Powell stars as the titular \"hit man\", a character more reminiscent of a frat boy with a gun than a hardened assassin. His attempts at humor fall flatter than a pancake, relying heavily on tired slapstick and juvenile jokes that wouldn't even elicit a chuckle from a laugh track.Adria Arjona plays his love interest, a role that feels about as necessary as a screen door on a submarine. Their romantic subplot is as forced and unconvincing as a Hollywood marriage, adding nothing of substance to an already lackluster plot.Linklater's direction, usually known for its subtlety and depth, feels completely out of place here. It's as if he's trying to juggle too many genres at once, resulting in a messy mishmash of half-baked ideas that never quite come together. The pacing is as erratic as a squirrel on caffeine, leaving viewers wondering if they accidentally hit fast forward on the remote.The comedy itself is as stale as week-old bread, relying on tired clichés and recycled jokes that were tired the first time around. Powell's attempts at comic timing feel as awkward as a first date, while Arjona's straight-faced delivery only serves to highlight the lack of humor in the script.Overall, \"Hit Man\" is a swing and a miss for Netflix, offering little more than a cringe-inducing comedy that's as forgettable as yesterday's news. If you're looking for a laugh, you're better off rewatching old episodes of \"The Office\" or \"Parks and Recreation.\" As for \"Hit Man,\" it's a contract best left unfulfilled.",

Okay, now you pay for it with more time than those being put away for hiring a killer please. Or a twist where she only lied about it to seem tough. And Gary is shocked and turned off at first.Second ruin, yet slightly entertaining and understandable: He is forced to wear a wire to get her confession, helps her and himself out of this dilemma. Not okay but let's see what's next.Yet next is Ruin Number Three: Let's kill a cop and get away with it. He was racist and misogynistic, he beat up some kids, he deserves death. Yeah, sure, because that's the 'enlightened' sign'o'the times. When moralistic self-righteous people don't look in the mirror.Wow. Just wow. Why make that part up? What was gained? Black comedy? Fail.This is not a Tarantino movie. Tarantino movies are art. This is warped. Not funny. 'Be who you wanna be' - a killer, that's a-okay, at least he turned from boring to hot.And I LIKE Nietzsche.

Then it changed I couldn't believe it, looked like a rom-com but then it changes again and it seems to stop, as I did I wondered how it was going to happen and my wife thought something else. Either of our ideas would have been better and it really does turn into unfunny romance. Only the other day I picked up a £1 DVD in a charity shop I'd never heard of it, Beautiful Creatures (2000) and it really was like a noir and it was very funny and it had an early one of Rachel Weisz which was wonderful. Those killers were really scary but in the Hit-Man they certainly were not but surely they were supposed to, or maybe not.",

        "description": "If you enjoy quirky movies, director Richard Linklater is your guy. His latest is HIT MAN, which is a romantic comedy that's very loosely based on an article about a real guy, Gary Johnson. Gary (Glen Powell) is a college professor and part-time staffer at the New Orleans Police Department. He stumbles into a new role as an undercover hitman, arresting people who try hiring him to kill someone. It turns out he's very good at it. Powell really showcases his talents here, playing different characters for each arrest. When he meets Madison (Adria Arjona) though, he breaks protocol. I guess Powell has great chemistry with whoever he works with. He has an undeniable charm that seems like it spreads to the whole cast. I could tell they had fun filming this. It also has a very smart script, playing with ideas of identity and being your true self. The strong sense of humour actually changes as the movie progresses, which was fun for me, but might not work for some. I find it hilarious that they must've asked the real Gary Johnson for permission to go as far as they do here. The movie makes it clear what actually happened during the end credits. HIT MAN is quirky, unconventional, and very enjoyable. If you can't see it in theaters, don't worry! It'll be on Netflix June 7th. Make sure the algorithm doesn't bury it. Enjoy!",

        "date": "7 October 2023",
        "description": "Hitman is definitely a film-lover's paradise but even the casual film viewer will thoroughly enjoy this brilliant new movie. Linklater's latest lovingly pays homage to film noir, screwball comedy, Hitchcockian black comedy and even the good old psychosexual drama but it still somehow manages to conjure up a fresh, witty and often uproarious confection that frequently teases, delights and occasionally thrills the audience with frissons of excitement, keeping them enraptured all the way to its deliciously razor sharp ending.This is potentially a star-making turn for Glen Powell. Although he made a strong impression in Top Gun: Maverick as a cocky rival pilot, his role in Hit Man is easily more complex and, as the co-writer of the script, he has been able to add brilliant layers to his character, or should that be characters? In effect, Powell is playing more than one character - Gary Johnson, mild-mannered, cat-loving geeky Psychology professor and audio techie who moonlights as a surveillance expert for a Louisana-based police unit that targets and stings hapless ne'er-do-wells who are looking to hire a killer. Before the next sting operation, Gary's police colleague Jasper (Austin Amelio) who normally pretends to be the hired killer is suspended for brutally attacking two youths, which forces Gary's colleagues (brilliantly played by Retta and Sanjay Rao) into convincing Gary to take over from the universally loathed Jasper, much to Gary's dismay. Yet, within minutes of taking on the task, Gary suddenly morphs into \"Ron\" and during his first sting he is so convincing that his colleagues are shocked, even though they had believed he could do it having heard Jasper go through the rigamarole on previous occasions. It is a brilliant piece of acting.Having created the killer persona, Gary soon finds himself becoming more and more immersed in Ron, adding further, chameleon-like layers of disguise and character traits to mirror whoever is about to be stung. However, things become really complicated (in true film noir style) when \"Ron\" is approached by a femme fatale, Maddy (beautifully played by Adria Ajrona who also adds a delightfully a kooky sexy edge as well as a tender vulnerability). As the sparks between the two begin to fly during a hilarious but flirty exchange, Gary, who is clearly enjoying himself as Ron, finds himself conflicted. Dare he. As Ron, continue with the sting and have Maddy arrested for plotting to murder her husband? Has the flirtatious exchange caused Maddy to betray some regrets about what she is doing? The chemistry between Powell and Arjona is a pleasure to witness. Both actors bring out the best in one another and it is thrilling.Off-beat is an expression that would certainly apply to Hit Man - and it is a compliment. It is also one of the most enjoyable and fun 2 hours I've had in the cinema in the past few years. I absolutely adore this film.",

That doesn't scare Gary away ..no he's in love and has cats So to even out Gary commits his own murder. And right then next to a dying man that they had just drugged and murder they have sex!That people find this funny is beyond me. Not sure I am comfortable with people who do.

There is no doubt that Hit Man is a fun, maybe even entertaining, film at times. Seeing the magnificent Glenn Powell navigate the different personas he create for himself with considerable ease and suaveness is a great joy. But while this undercover average Joe turned hit-man idea may serve as an interesting premise, the film does not develop much from this premise meaningfully. The plot is overly slight, and the direction it goes is bizarre, especially the ending, which felt rushed and contrived. The plot does not develop in a manner which extracts full potential of comedy from its situation, and neither is it particularly entertaining. Also, Despite what some critics have praised, I could not see much chemistry between Arjona and Powell. Sure, they are both more than serviceable in their roles, and they share several steamy scenes, but there is no special spark or unique connection between the two. At the end of the day, I find Hit Man very similar to The Fall Guy, a movie released at around the same time. Both are serviceable, fun, and entertaining distractions which can barely hold and audiences attention for two hours. But both are overly light on actual plot, are only mildly entertaining, and not as funny or enjoyable as they should have been.",

        "description": "My first experience with Glenn Powell was his supporting role in Top Gun: Maverick. He's been around much longer but he was good at playing the brash and cocky Hangman. He's been noteworthy in previous efforts (Hidden Figures was also mentioned by one of my friends) but I was blown away by his work in Hit Man, not only is he fantastic as the suave and smooth Ron but he's also convincing as the reserved and stale Gary (I do have some thoughts on how they present Gary, more on that later). But watching him in Hit Man, it felt like I was watching someone doing acting gymnastics, he's playing so many different and bizarre characters and he nailed every single one. He also has great chemistry with his co-star Adria Arjona, I was just as interested in the their torrid romance than I was in what costume Gary was going to shuffle into next. Speaking of Adria, her work in this was also noteworthy, it would have been easy to make assumptions about Madison's character if Adria's performance didn't make her so mysterious and alluring. She's beautiful, she got her fair share of laughs from me and I was surprised at how invested I was in Gary and Madison's relationship by the end of the movie. I also wanted to credit Austin Amelio, Retta and Sanjay Rao for their collective work in their supporting parts. Another expectation the movie subverts is painting Jasper as a two dimensional villain, Austin makes Jasper unlikeable but not inhuman or not believable as Gary's dejected co-worker.Besides the performances, my favourite part of Hit Man was how it subverts the formula. I can't call it wholly and completely original but I was constantly trying to guess the next twist or shift in the narrative based on similar films. Hit Man continued to zag when I expected it to zig and it's so well layered. Director Richard Linklater and his team have a sense of when they need to switch things up, just when the movie gets too goofy, we get more time with Ron & Madison bonding or when you're about to guess when a twist will happen, the movie will suddenly get much darker. There's several tones at play but they are mixed together so precisely that it kept me entertained when I feel like another movie would have lost me.So many movies are \"based\" on a true story and sure enough, Hit Man isn't the unvarnished truth up on the screen. But the movie is cognizant of the fatigue that comes with this claim and admits it upfront. It helps that the true story is so fantastical that I wasn't bothered in how they tweaked it. Despite the changes, Hit Man is so good natured and seems to being celebrating Gary's unbelievable skill set that I didn't get bogged down in what was true and what wasn't.Hit Man slowly builds toward the finale and despite climax being morally murkier and darker tinged than I maybe expected, I loved how the ending punctuated what was a hugely enjoyable film. I was rooting for Gary/Ron and Madison despite what was revealed about them and it's captured wonderfully by Linklater. The movie doesn't pause to scold you for being sympathetic to one party or another and I liked that it wasn't too concerned with the absolute morality of the characters. The film ends with a metaphorical wink to the audience and it felt like a chef's kiss on a delicious meal.I'm going to be brief about any griping, My only problem is that they don't do a wholly convincing job of dressing Glen Powell down to be the nerdy and shy Gary Johnson when he's just being himself. It's reminiscent of sitcoms slapping glasses on models to trying to present them as dowdy. When everyone is making jokes about how \"normal\" and \"unassuming\" Gary looks, I rolled my eyes a little. But I guess Glen Powell being too handsome to be terribly convincing as a geek college professor is a nice problem to have.Hit Man was such a pleasant surprise, I felt like I was taking a gamble taking friends to see it in the theatre with me but we all walked out impressed. It made me a little sad that it was simultaneously released on Netflix, this is a theatre quality movie and while I understand it might have had a tougher road to profitability than your typical summer tentpole, it earned my ticket price. The film is so much fun, Glen Powell and Adria Arjona light up the screen and the fact that it's based on a true story is just delightful (I loved the end credits joke on how they changed the story). I tip my hat to Powell, Linklater & his team and the real Gary Johnson, I had a great time with Hit Man. I'd rate this at an 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9/10 and while you should check it out on Netflix, you won't regret going to see it in theatres either.",

        "description": "Richard Linklater's (Before Sunrise trilogy, Boyhood) latest film is getting very good reviews so it's quite a surprise once you see it that it's average at best. One of the reasons for that is the lack of variety and emotion Glen Powell puts in (or doesn't) in his performance. There should be a duality between his build-up cocky Ron hit man persona and Gary, his softer, nerdier, normal day-to-day self. Yet, when he supposedly switches between one and the other there's no real substantial difference between the two besides a cosmetic one. One would think this would be the role to show his acting prowess but there seems to be very little and this is nowhere near Bryan Cranston's duality performance skills as Walter White in Breaking Bad if we were to compare an actors task of switching between two sides of a character.There's never any palpable tension in Gary/Ron, he's always in control. He's in control when he becomes the face of the supposed hit-man for the first time (no nervousness, nothing), he is in control when everything starts to unravel, he's in control when he's being confronted with his actions during the climax of the film, and so on - and the film suffers very much from it as we never go along with the main character or actually worry about him, as the main actor never really does anything with it.Likewise, it's a bit boring at times, the cinematography is beyond plain and it's very predictable. The film would have been so much better had it been more stylised, with a more substantial visual flair and a cool soundtrack at least to cover its flaws, since overall there's not really much meat to the story and the film ends up being about nothing.",

Based on a true story, the film features commendable performances, particularly from Glen Powell, but suffers from a lack of character development and emotional depth.Glen Powell delivers a standout performance, embodying his character with a mix of charm and authenticity that makes him a compelling figure to watch. His nuanced portrayal brings a layer of believability to the narrative, making the moments of action and subtle humor particularly enjoyable. Powell's ability to infuse his role with both intensity and a touch of levity is one of the film's highlights.The movie does offer a few humorous moments that provide a welcome break from the otherwise serious tone. These lighter scenes are well-executed and add a layer of entertainment, making the film a decent choice for those looking for a casual watch. However, the humor alone is not enough to compensate for the film's more significant shortcomings.One of the primary issues with \"Hitman\" is its lack of character development. Despite the film being based on a true story, the characters feel underdeveloped and one-dimensional. There is a noticeable absence of emotional depth, which makes it difficult for the audience to connect with or care about the characters on a deeper level. This lack of character growth and exploration is a missed opportunity that could have elevated the film from being merely good to something truly impactful.Richard Linklater's direction, while competent, fails to fully capitalize on the story's potential. The narrative feels rushed at times, and the pacing issues detract from the overall impact of the film. There are moments that hint at deeper emotional and psychological layers, but these are never fully explored, leaving the audience with a sense of incompleteness.In conclusion, \"Hitman\" is a film that is good for passing the time but doesn't leave a lasting impression. Glen Powell's strong performance and the film's occasional humor make it worth a watch, but the lack of character development and emotional depth prevent it from being anything more than a mildly entertaining diversion. With a more nuanced approach to storytelling and character development, \"Hitman\" could have been much more impactful.",

Gary Johnson carries out this pretense in order to entrap those looking to hire an assassin.The film's introductory sequences show restaurant encounters where he convinces several would-be murderers he's a hardened criminal in the liquidation business. These meetings are recorded, and the conspirators arrested after clearly stating their intent and handing over a down-payment. Linklater's narrative departs from reality when a beautiful Latina asks him to terminate her abusive husband. To the confusion of his handlers, Gary refuses her payment, and suggests she initiate divorce proceedings instead of contracting a homicide. Needless to say, complications ensue when he secretly starts an affair with her while maintaining his killer-for-hire persona.'Hit Man' could have followed in the footsteps of modern classics like 'Body Heat', but Linklater chooses to play it for light comedy rather than drama. Tension is lost as the proceedings become increasingly frivolous and unlikely. The acting performances and amusing screenplay just about hold one's interest, but the end-result feels like an insubstantial appetizer that could have been a memorable main course with a different approach.",

Adria Arjona knows how to compliment Powell's quirky charm perfectly and the meticulous pacing makes the film feel like a breeze to watch. The movie has witty comedy, steamy romance, and an all around engaging atmosphere to keep you more than satisfied throughout its runtime.

Then Austin Amelio, the cop who usually talks to the would-be clients to get them to say they want someone dead and give him money is pulled from active service. He's a dirty cop. Apparently there's nothing wrong with that in the Big Easy, but the video went viral.So Powell steps in. He discovers a real talent for playing a fake hit man, and the conviction rate goes way up. Then, Adria Arjona wants her husband dead, but won't come out and say it. Powell tells her to take the money she was going to give him and leave. Later, they meet up and start an affair, but she thinks it's with a hit man. Then her husband dies in an alley.Richard Linklater's movie is not just a good black comedy. It's also a statement about the current belief that you can change who you are by changing what you do. Intellectually it's a bit of a straw man argument in this movie, but it's a story, not a balanced lecture. If it was good enough for George Bernard Shaw, it's good enough for Linklater.",

        "description": "The hitman is already for a long time a popular character in crime and (neo) noir films. For me the ultimate hitman-film is \"The day of the jackal\" (1973, Fred Zinnemann). In this film Edward Fox plays a hitman that is professional, emotionless and a typical loner.Only the last description does apply to Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) in \"The hit man\". He is however not a real hit man but an undercover hit man. He meets people looking for a hit man and makes sure the compromising evidence is on tape.In order to do this he changes outfit all the time and this leads to a comic costume parade, including an imitation of Anton Chigur (Javier Bardem), the hit man from \"No country for old men\" (2007, Ethan & Joel Coen).Being partly a comedy, \"Hit man\" is an odd one in the oeuvre of director Richard Linklater, who is mostly known for his \"Before .... \" relation trilogy (1995, 2004,2013) and his coming of age film \"Boyhood\" (2014).\"Hit man\" really takes of when Gary Johnson falls in love with one of his clients (Maddy Masters played by Adria Arjona). It is the starting point of a roller coaster of numerous unexpected twists and turns.One of the themes is losing sight of the difference between your undercover \"me\" and your real \"me\". It happens in numerous film, but it also happens in reality. In an investigation from 1994 - 1996 the Dutch parliament studied how it happened by the police while combatting organized crime.The fact is however that Gary Johnson has two real \"me's\", one as a part-time police officer and one as a professor in philosophy. The last one delivers the philosophical theme of the movie of how to find a satisfactory balance between ratio and discipline (represented by the Greek God Apollo) and feeling, emotions, instincts and living dangerously (represented by the Greek God Dionysus).Remarkable is that where his most famous films (The \"Before\" trilogy and \"Boyhood\") are typical for an Apollonian world, \"Hit man\" descends to the depths of Dionysus.By the way, \"Hitman\" is in my opinion not very flattering for women, showing how they prefer the sex appeal of a hit man to that of a \"dull\" police officer (let alone a nerdy professor).",

Here, he's a rather geeky teacher (Gary) who teaches philosophy at a college whilst occasionally helping out the cops with some criminal profiling. When one of their investigators \"Jasper\" (Austin Amelio) goes a bit too far and gets suspended, Gary gets drafted in last minute and proves quite effective at getting folks who want to bump of their nearest and dearest for $5,000 to admit their cunning plans to a well wired-up con. The more of these cases he does, the better he gets; the more fun he has dressing up and adept he becomes at assuming a range of identities. It's \"Maddy\" (Adria Arjona) who sets the cat amongst the pigeons when she asks him to get shot of her thuggish husband \"Ray\" (Evan Holtzman). He takes a shine to her and talks her out of her criminal ploy. Quickly the two are seeing each other - which is manna from heaven for the deposed \"Jasper\". When her husband is found dead, he thinks he knows exactly who did what and how best to exact his revenge... It's quite an entertaining romantic thriller this, providing Powell with an opportunity to charm his way through an almost two hours of cinema that is light and fluffy, completely preposterous yet based on a true character. Arjona looks like she is having a good time here, too - and the last twenty minutes are quite fun. No, it won't trouble a BAFTA jury I suspect - but it's quite enjoyable summertime fayre.",

However at some point he starts to moonlight for the police first as tech support, then due to some circumstances as a fake hit man. That second act of the movie is good and entertaining in showing how he does what he does. Then enter Maddy Masters with a serious domestic issue at her hands, The sparks between them are there, they start a romance. Everything ok, until here still a mildly entertaining movie.The problem however is the third act. It's difficult to describe the issue without spoilers so here they come:\nMaddy's husband is dead. It turns out she has killed him. As the investigation shows, a recent life insurance policy could be motive. Gary is sent in to get a confession from Maddy. Instead that he is actively guiding her by providing her with clues how to appear innocent in the exchange.A bit problematic, but hey, this is not a documentary, it's fiction.But of course one of the cops figured out, that it was Maddy who killed her husband and now tries to blackmail her for some of the insurance money. Her solution to the problem: spiking his bottled beer (how?) so he gets unconscious while blackmailing Maddy and Gary. Gary's solution, as drugging a cop does not have the best looks: Killing the cop, obviously.And then, they live happily ever after.So we summarize: Maddy kills her husband probably for the insurance money, Gary covers it up by murdering a cop. Followed by a happy end. Shall this really be the moral of the story? I have my difficulties with that.",

While I don't exactly find it really good and just find at a good rom-com flick, Hit Man offers a more respectable approach that is a nice change of pace of various \"Based on a true story\" movies. Instead of trying to make it seem like all the events in the movie happened in real life in a deceiving manner, Hit Man, based on a real person, openly states the inaccuracies in the movie that are much different from real life events. I find various movies these days don't offer this type of respect to real people or events and the idea of adding fantasy elements and blending them with reality results in some people believing it entirely. This results in a different view towards certain real people and events, which is all just very manipulative and upsetting. While this isn't really that big of an issue (except when it's done a problematic way, such as disrespecting loss of life, tragedy, etc.) but I really do appreciate Hit Man's honesty about it. I absolutely recommend Hit Man as a fun watch and I do love how respectful it is to the real people it's based around.",

The film raises some interesting existential questions, literally. And it's attempts to elevate the material from standard 'rom-com' should be commended, but unfortunately the execution of that ends up being it's undoing.The Bad: This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. First, the pacing. The first hour or so is slow and monotonous. With scenes being repeated as if the film is trying to prove a point, but doesn't actually add anything to the overall character / narrative. Secondly, the film tries too hard to fit in a bunch of different genres and tropes. Is it a rom-com? Sometimes. Is it a dark comedy? I guess. Is it a movie which asks existential questions whilst exploring that theme with the characters? It tries to. Unfortunately it all just mixes into a big pile of bleh. When it could have been so much more if it cut some of the bloat and redundant scenes. Disappointing.Summary: It's not bad and the last half is actually pretty decent. But if you're looking for a classic rom-com with some caper style shenanigns (curse you trailer) - you're not going to find it here. If you're not looking for that, go for it.",

It's the kind of story that, much like Edgar Wright's Baby Driver or Shaun of the Dead, would've made for a mediocre movie if directed by an amateur, but made for a great movie because it was directed by an experienced industry professional. All Linklater films are good films.This film keeps you guessing from beginning to end and tells its story in a way that makes the audience feel like they are learning and growing along with the characters. A great example of this is when the film periodically cuts back to Glen Powell's character, Gary Johnson, lecturing students on the everyday behaviors of people. Gary casually and subtly uses his experience as an undercover investigator as the building blocks for these lessons. By doing this, Gary is also introducing and breaking down the overarching themes of the film. It truly is brilliant storytelling.There will never be enough words to properly commend the actors in this film. They brought so much life and enthusiasm to their characters in constant battle between show stealers. In this battle, there were no winners or losers. The acting was balanced and cast members complimented their costars exquisitely.Linklater and Powell's writing was entertaining, truly comedic, well paced, and extremely thoughtful. It is definitely a must see for film buffs searching for depth and those just looking for a fun surface-level comedy. It does both properly in all respects.",

        "description": "Hit Man is a new action comedy directed, written and produced in part by Richard Linklater, director of Boyhood and Before Midnight.Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) is a school teacher, but also secretly works for the police. At one point he has to play a fake hitman with the police. He is hired by clients to commit murders, but after clients confess their criminal plans to Gary, the police can arrest them.When Madison Masters (Adria Arjona) wants to hire Gary, he falls for her beauty. This causes him to break his own rules and try to change Madison's mind so that she does not carry out criminal plans. The two fall in love, but Madison actually falls for the hitman Ron, who played Gary for her. On the other hand, Gary shouldn't show that he's broken his own code to Madison because it could get him in trouble with the police and ruin his career.This film is based on a true story, where the real Gary Johnson posed himself to the police as a hitman who criminals could hire to commit murders. Only after sharing their murderous plans with Gary could the police catch them. The real Gary Johnson had to dress up so many times, wearing different styles of clothes and wigs to appear different to each criminal, so he couldn't be exposed as an undercover cop. Glen Powell also does the same at the beginning of the film. He wears different costumes and also acts in different ways. For example, the film starts off more like an action comedy, but when Gary falls for Madison, the film turns more into a romantic comedy.Richard Linklater provides a comic action film, but with repeated events, where Gary, in different disguises, makes various criminals confess. When the film later turns more into a romantic comedy, this mainly works because of the good chemistry between Glen Powell and Adria Arjona, their characters. Glen Powell only plays a character who leads a double life and his character ends up in a relationship with the possible criminal. This creates complicated situations in which he has to continue working strategically, without Madison or the police realizing that he is actually lying to both of them. However, the film does have a somewhat abrupt ending, which does not seem to answer everything.Glen Powell plays the lead role well and actually has to play the role in different ways. This gives him the opportunity to show different acting capabilities in this film. Adria Arjona also plays the role of a seductive, possible criminal well, because as a viewer, like the main characters, you do not always know whether she can be completely trusted. After his time in various Walking Dead series, Austin Amelio also gets the chance to act in a film. He plays a colleague of the main character, who may thwart his strategic plans if he is told too much.",

He's able to play a fun variety of hit men, but that isn't really the central focus. Adria Arjona is pretty good at the love interest with what could best be described as innocently dark intentions.The jokes from many of the side characters didn't really work for me, most notably Gary's two police associates, played by Retta and Sanjay Rao. There seemed to be some kind of underlying message about how we're all capable of change in one way or another, but I feel like that was included to justify the surprisingly dark yet underwhelming ending this movie pulls.Overall, there's not much to say about Hit Man, aside from being an occasionally darkly humorous and empty movie that you'd put on when you don't want to think too hard.",

I can't fault the performances, and it is a fun enjoyable watch, which is worth viewing at home. I did get a bit of an insight into a whole 'world' of detective work that is legal and I was shocked by how scarily common it is for a spouse, or disgruntled friend/relation/colleague/rival to attempt to set up a hitman to kill.Having since read a bit about the guy upon whom this film's main character is based, his 'success' is undeniable. The parallel lives he led is impressive and fascinating. The statistics we are given on screen are accurate. But, it does become rather a farfetched plot and in some cases of 'based on true events' films I've really felt 'truth can be stranger/more wild than fiction '.However, in the case of Hitman, the twists and turns the story takes are fictional, and discovering this was slightly disappointing but I guess it also makes me feel they did a good job at using a true character and expanding/fleshing out an entertaining yarn!I'd love to see a documentary on this guy, and/or a different director/filmmakers create a more serious, exploration of him or other people who work undercover, and the impact this has upon their psyche, relationships, and the type of person who can actually live a life like this.",

Gary, wearing multiple disguises for his wildly different clients, can further enhance his lectures on the self: \"What if your self is a construct?\" he asks his students.Gary remains an operative who never kills anyone until he meets comely client, Maddy (Adria Arjona), and is drawn into a caper as Ron and lover, possibly becoming at least an accomplice to murder. Meanwhile, director Richard Linklater, who knows a thing or two about actors as lovers, weaves the romance with college lectures on identity and psychological self-styling, common threads in our social-media landscape. Our ability to create our own persona on Facebook or Snapchat, for example, is not unlike his profession, but not quite as dangerous, mostly.You don't need to know Nietzsche to believe that a mild-mannered professor could play a hit man (a student exclaims, \"When did our teacher get hot?\") or that anyone could construct a personality with the help of the Internet. The film becomes more than an amusing thriller as identities play a key role in furthering a promising romance or solving a crime that has murder as a centerpiece.Although more than once it's claimed there are no hitmen now or in history, Hit Man goes a long way in convincing us that they could be real. In more than one extended dialogue, Gary/Ron explains the complexity and allure of switching identities.Hit Man has its own double identity-cool summer caper and dangerous romance, both threatened by electronic surveillance and the human capability of shifting its persona throughout life. Although the subject of identity crafting involving the id, the ego, and the superego can't be adequately discussed in a brief TV melodrama, Hit Man does give one pause. And a brisk summer breeze.",

It's like Fletch meets Confessions of a Dangerous Mind with a bit of The Nice Guys and, of course, Linklater's trademark philosophical schtick added. Make no mistake, this isn't trying to be Chinatown - it's most certainly a comedy, in line with the aforementioned movies. There's a lot to like here!Glen Powell is a funny and charming guy who's rising quickly - he's got that Ryan Reynolds, Gosling thing. A touch of Sam Rockwell, too. This is a great role for him!Aaand now the negative - it wrapped up too neatly. I, unfortunately, didn't entirely buy the love story. While intriguing (there was some chemistry!), it was too cut and dry. I'm surprised Linklater went in this direction, frankly, and not sure what to say about it. I guess he had his fun with this zany story and gave us a happy ending, but it felt disingenuous. Didn't ruin it for me, just surprised by the Hollywood ending 🤷‍♂️Overall, I can't deny that it's a step in the right direction for what people want to see. This is entertainment. It delivered. It's funny, sexy and mysterious with good looking people! It's ok to want that - it's what Hollywood was built on. It's been a while since I've enjoyed a newer movie like this, so I'm pretty happy with my 2 hr experience. Flaws and all, it's just fun!",

How was this good guy going to get out of the mess he'd inadvertently created? I wanted to see.But it seems the writers found the situation too difficult to get out of themselves, so in the last few minutes, they cut away from that moral arc and opt instead for an absolutely perverse Hollywood ending: the \"good\" guys choose to transform themselves into \"evil\" guys and then live as \"pretend-to-be-good\" guys in a happily-ever-after Hallmark moment. What?!! Are we supposed to feel good that they got away with murdering two people, neither of them in self-defense, because they are now empowered and sexy? Some excuses were made about how some people \"deserve to be killed\"; apparently this means anyone who is in your way or that you find annoying! This comes from a character who teaches philosophy, his philosophy finally being: be whomever you want to be, just don't be boring. (Being evil is okay, because that's \"hot\"!)I can't say this message is unique in Hollywood these days, the only difference being that this movie is a wolf in sheep's clothing, posing as a rom-com that is actually a tragic farce.Don't bring your children to watch this, unless your goal is to raise sexy little murderers.",

Powell is paired perfectly with Adria Arjona, who is a newcomer to me, and oh boy, she is a delight on the screen. From the moment she appears, you are rooting for her.

As it is, he passed away in 2022 before \"Hit Man\" started filming, but it's known that the love interest part of the film was entirely fictional, so at least he didn't die a murderer.This was an entertaining flick up to a point, but it got truly weird when Gary (Glen Powell) arrived at Madison Masters' apartment and coached her through a string of lies while his police department associates listening in tried to catch her admitting that she killed her husband. She had already done so with Gary, which caused him to freak out and give up his fake identity as 'Ron' the hitman. Quite honestly, I can't imagine how the guy was able to make with a comeback for every prospective client who was looking to have someone eliminated. The guy never said the wrong thing and had an answer for every eventuality. Talk about thinking on one's feet!So even though this picture might have been based on a true story, the whole thing had an air of incredulity about it. Getting back to the real Gary Johnson, he assisted in the arrests of more than 70 people seeking contract killers using aliases when it suited his purpose. The Madison Masters character was based on a woman that Johnson referred to social services and a therapist to get the help she needed to end an abusive relationship. When all was said and done, Gary Johnson never did kill anyone as a supposed contract killer, nor did Glen Powell's character, who probably would have missed if he had to pull the trigger.",

It is of a fake contract hitman who is assigned as a spoof character by the cops to lure victims of paying contracts out to clients.Except the people paying out become the victims. So one day he falls for a dark-haired woman called Madison Figueroa Masters; played by Adria Arjona and he tells her not to pull on the hit and take the money and run.This is when it all changes his life and her life. It's quite an obvious script from her as the actor acting as the hitman becomes more like the styled hitman he pretends to be; because he has fallen for this girl and is seducing her.She is in lust with his protective character and natural charm; chilvary and etiquitte. Something which her arsehole husband clearly lacks.There are a few twists and turns which you can probably figure out along the way. It's an unrealistic story and it's not a convincing police operation. It is acted very well and the cinema is descent enough but it just is a rushed film and why is it two hours long? It really doesn't need to be. Anyther disappointing straight-to-netflix release.The lead protagonist; Glen Powell does a very good job of blending Ryan Gosling with Garry Oldman. Glen is a superb actor. A shame that the script was just too silly and romanticised. 6/10. Production is excellent. Acting strong.",

However, the chemistry between him and the female lead is lacking, and their sensual scenes feel forced and unnatural. The female lead's exaggerated attempts to be alluring through her facial expressions were particularly distracting.Despite these issues, the movie is fun and entertaining. Glen Powell's fans will especially enjoy his charm and energy. The film's upbeat nature makes it a good choice for a casual movie night. However, the disparity in acting abilities among the cast is noticeable and somewhat diminishes the film's potential. If all the actors had matched Powell's level of performance, the movie could have been much better.In conclusion, while I'm not a huge fan of Glen Powell, I can appreciate his strong performance in this film. I hope future projects feature a more balanced ensemble cast to complement his talents. Thanks for reading my review, and I hope you all enjoy the movie despite its flaws!",

        "description": "Believe the hype: Richard Linklater and Glen Powell's Hit Man is awesome! It's a slick, sexy screwball comedy about identity that only a filmmaker like Richard Linklater could properly pull off! I'd say this might even be the must see romantic dark comedy of the decade! Hit Man is definitely a film-lover's paradise but even the casual film viewer will thoroughly enjoy this brilliant new movie. Linklater's latest lovingly pays homage to film noir, screwball comedy, Hitchcockian black comedy and even the good old psychosexual drama but it still somehow manages to conjure up a fresh, witty, and often uproarious confection that frequently teases, delights, and occasionally thrills the audience with frissons of excitement, keeping them enraptured all the way to its deliciously razor sharp ending. Go in blind - it's such a fun movie to experience with a crowd, knowing nothing of what's to come! I absolutely loved my experience watching this movie - it's a shame most people will experience it on Netflix for the first time. But because this movie is so unique and fun to experience knowing nothing about it - I'm gonna keep this short in order to preserve the experience of watching it for the first time! This film has been hyped up for months and yet it was still able to surpass everything I expected of it. This was some fresh, fun, effortless storytelling that works so well, and truly allows Glen Powell to ascend to a new level of movie stardom with such a charismatic performance! This is potentially a star-making turn for Glen Powell. Although he made a strong impression in Top Gun: Maverick as a cocky rival pilot, his role in Hit Man is easily more complex and, as the co-writer of the script, he has been able to add brilliant layers to his character, or should that be characters? His chemistry with the equally terrific Adria Arjona was dynamite, they both had true movie star energy! Both actors bring out the best in one another and it is thrilling! Hit Man is one of the most entertaining films of the year - a slick, cool, and hilarious crime film that deconstructs our notion of what a hitman is while simultaneously examining its lead character's ID, EGO, and SUPEREGO. This is Linklater at his most fun and effortless. A masterclass on direction, writing, and acting, Hit Man is a wild, entertaining ride that I can't wait to see many more times! I LOVED Hit Man, it left me with the biggest smile! It's a - hit, man!",

A philosophy professor moonlighting with a side gig assisting the NOLA Police Department who suddenly falls into the role of a lifetime when he fills in as a hit man for hire insn ongoing sting operation to thwart murder for hire plots. Much to everybody's surprise (himself included), it turns out he's really good at it.Along the way, he falls for a woman who initially comes to him to order a hit on her husband. Their chemistry unavoidable, he talks her out of it, they fall in love and then , in a sudden dark turn, she kills her husband. Yeah, she kills her husband.Rather than a moment of profound tonal shift into Coen Brotheresque neo-noir territory, the story continues apace along the same breezy pace before this shoulda been shocking event. There's no great reckoning. None. This would be weird for any character but for a philosophy professor with a deep regard for the moral clarity and ethics he espouses to his students in class all semester, it's particularly odd. Instead he lets it slide, comes clean with his love interest that he's really not a true hit man and in the process of participating in a murder to cover up the first murder effectively becomes the real thing.In more capable hands this could have been a classic slapdash 60s Cary Grant rom-com even with the unusual twist but it falls way short of anything especially comical or memorable. Like some of Linklater's other movies, there's a tonally flat quality that renders what should have been a really surprising transition little more than half baked and unnecessary. Whatever investment you've made in the characters feel like a waste.",

One day though, looking to set up a young woman eager to kill her brutal husband, he falls for her and convinces her to back away. A romance begins which gets more and more complicated as he continues to play at being Ron.Fun stuff, which starts off as a straight comedy as he traps all sorts of eccentrics who want to kill husbands and wives etc. However, when the romance starts each scene ramps up the complications with the story becoming increasing dark and seemingly impossible for Gary to escape prison, get the girl etc. Powell is really good - truly now looking like a big star presence - looking at identity and whether it is possible to embrace a new one if required, in turn requiring him to play lots of different characters in order to catch the baddies.

It's not your typical action-packed, slapstick comedy; instead, it offers a more intellectual and reflective experience.If you're expecting a mainstream action-comedy, take a closer look at the director's name! Linklater, known for films like \"Boyhood,\" \"Everybody Wants Some!!,\" \"Before Sunset,\" \"Before Sunrise,\" \"Before Midnight,\" and \"School of Rock,\" brings his unique touch to \"HIT MAN,\" making it a worthwhile watch for those who appreciate deeper narratives and character studies.",

I love how Gary just turned into Ron by the End. I was just thinking at start of movie that with these kind of abilities and knowledge he cam be a great evil person and that's what happens at the end. The only thing i didn't like was how lightly they treated the murder she did i get it that's it's a comedy but they should've some kind of remorse or anything and i didn't like how they were just making it look a good ending as they just killed 2 people and still we're portraying them as Movie's heroes.",

        "description": "I believe there are 2 cardinal rules to filmmaking, if you stick to these things most people will enjoy your film. They are:1) The audience should like your protagonists\n2) Have a good ending\"Hit Man\" breaks both rules. It pains me to say that, because 75% of the film I mostly enjoyed. I thought the leads acted well, good chemistry, etc.The film wasn't that funny, if it was trying to be a black comedy, which I \"think\" it was? But as a romantic film it was okay enough. Unfortunately the ending just wasn't well conceived.I thought the final act, as the cops closed in on Madison being a killer, was well set up. But the film decided to give Gary, the male lead, not only a different personality at the end of it all, but a completely different moral compass as well.I looked forward to the final scene between the protagonists, Gary and Madison, and their showdown with a dirty cop.Up to this point, Gary was portrayed as a likable enough guy who seemed to want to do the right thing, even if he occasionally bent the rules it was for the right reasons. Until, well until......Gary mysteriously transforms at the end of the film into a cold blooded cop killer. Who kills his colleague, in a completely blatant act. Just 180 degree turn in character. Was the sex \"that\" good?But besides being an out of character move, the twist makes the protagonists into negative characters, right at the end, so this becomes the lasting impression of them.Weirdly, I think the director frames the actions as strangely just, because Madison's husband \"might've been a jerk\", but this was never shown on screen. The murdered cop was also talked about as being a bad guy but he was never depicted as a bad guy on screen.So because we have to take the word of the characters that these people deserved to die, and that makes it okay? Weird, weird ending.",

My attention drifted and I began to browse reviews of the movie on my phone, trying to work out how I had been sold such a pup. The two leads are compelling attractive, but the quick-fire scenes used to build their on-screen romance felt tired and clichéd after the enjoyable run of scenes that preceded it, where we see Gary developing his hitman personas to suit his varied client base (with no shortage of intertextual references to other films with memorable killers).The movie picks up in the second half, culminating in one remorseless scene that brings together its themes and philosophy. It was enough to make up for the otherwise uncomfortable sense that the film was a slightly overlong apology for state-sanctioned murder and personal vigilante justice, disguised as a romantic comedy.I was left with the feeling that Hit Man could have been a much tighter, more engaging film if it was only about 25 minutes shorter.",

        "description": "Based on a monthly magazine article which itself was about a very real person, Gary Johnson. A psychology professor by profession, he also assists the New Orleans police department by going undercover. When another police who was tasked with going undercover as a fake hitman is suspended, Gary steps up to become Ron the hitman to catch the potential criminals who approach to hire him. What happens when Gary posing as Ron gets to meet a client and it's love at first sight? What trouble he gets into and how does he come out of the situation, forms rest of the story.Richard Linklater narrates this particular story which shifts gear when it comes to varied genres and it definitely helps to have a charming lead. Gary loves his job and is happy taking care of his pets so when he does get offered to go undercover, he gives his 100% to turn into a fake hit man and an ordinary professor turning into this charmer, is a transition well executed. The humor filled dialogues help ease out even when things seems to get serious. This is a genre that made me want some bigger twist in the final act but Richard chose to be loyal in narrating Gary's story or to say, not that predictable as I expected the story to be. Majority of the fun lies in those lines uttered not just by the lead actors and it's this smart balanced writing where the film wins big time.",

I know Powell is already a leading man but I think he is about to launch into superstardom. This role gave him the chance to show off some range and he was also more handsome and sexier in some of his personas than I have ever seen him before. Not just goody goody boy next store with an awful script (like a different recent Glen Powell movie I had the misfortune of watching) but confident, handsome man with some depth and surprises. And wit! And Arjona was just as talented and gorgeous. While the performances were excellent and thoroughly enjoyable (also from Austin Amelio), the script gave them all something substantive to work with. It's not Shakespeare but it is so much better than the usual crappy, predictable writing with uni-dimensional characters and over-the-top villains. It was witty, it had twists and turns (some of which one can see coming but a few of which surprised me). It was not as dark as I expected and maybe mixing neo-noir with rom-com would annoy some purists. But I just let it be what it is and appreciated seeing something that I have not already seen several times. I often multitask while watching movies but I didn't with this movie. It kept my attention and I didn't want to miss any of it--even facial expressions and, of course, the dynamics between the leads. I was sorry it ended and will definitely watch it again sometime.",

For the majority of the runtime this is an easygoing rom com but it gradually reveals a darker side without losing any of the charm of everything that preceded it. It's a really fun look at the many faces and personalities people can employ depending on the situation and if some people even have a true self.This feels like the final step in Glen Powell's road to becoming a fully fledged movie star. It's the ideal performance to showcase all of his leading man talents thanks to the many performances within the main performance, allowing him to remain thoroughly charming whilst skillfully blurring the lines between Gary and Ron as it goes along.Adria Ajorna is just as essential to this film working and gets an almost equally layered performance that deserves to make her a star as well. Her chemistry with Powell is electric from their very first encounter and she makes her character empathetic whilst adding a sense of mystery to her character as their relationship develops.Richard Linklater is on top form here with understated direction that plays to his strengths. He has a way of making his films feel so warm, trundling along nicely in a way that's patient yet engrossing with characters who are a pleasure to spend 2 hours with. Plus it still feels refreshing to see a mainstream film that isn't afraid to get hot and heavy.",

Definitely a novel plot where a quintessential University Professor Gary Johnson ( Glen Powell) who teaches psychology/ philosophy and whose hobby is tinkering with electronics lands up as an undercover agent with the local police department. He has the dubious job of trapping desparados who are ready to pay hitmen like him to eliminate people. He does well, the cops like him but his infatuation for a pretty female client creates problems for him and the police department. Things get messy when a murder takes place, an investigation is ordered and he is a suspect too.Director Richard Linklater had impressed me in \" Boyhood \" but this tale of intrigue and crime is totally a different ball game as far as narratives go. Nevertheless it is a riveting plot and the situations get murkier as the storyline unfolds. Glen Powell is at ease with the changing hues of the character he plays. (Interesting to note that he has collaborated as the writer with Linklater.) The movie could be termed as a dark thriller with the protagonist in a twin personality of the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde type. Adria Arjona as the love interest and Austin Amelio as the colleague have given strong support.",

I think they try to deliver the philosophy part or want to explain why or how characters develop in movies, which people already know. It just makes the story not go smoothly, it has Gary do his job and then come to have sex with Madison 3 times just to let us know that She has the knowledge to set up a murder from the after-sex talk. Rather than develop an antagonist story. So all we got from Jasper is a villain who lost his job because of himself and can't get back because of Gary. And U know what the final scene when Jasper is defeated they just add a sex scene for no reason. But overall it's pretty funny and that is the whole purpose.

But at the end he stood up with a projector and pitched us on joining his pyramid scheme. Thats what this movie feels like - its a hell of a ride but when you get to the end you cant help but feel like all the good was made to soften the blow of the terrible ending. At the end you start to realize it's really an hour and a half or so of great fun that's written to convince you to overlook the moral and emotional objections you're bound to have when the movie's over. But it doesn't work. The objections linger. And as much as I wish I wasn't, I was dissatisfied.Above all else Hit Man is entertaining. Glen Powell shows off a surprising range playing not only Gary, but all of Gary's made-up versions of himself. He's somehow able to covey believable emotion as different characters and still win us over as he navigates the morally ambiguous world of undercover sting operations. I was also very impressed by Adria Arjona who could solicit a hitman and still feel innocent and could be so seductive without it feeling camp. I have a feeling we'll be hearing her name everywhere soon enough. Overall the chemistry was undeniable and these core performances made the movie as enjoyable as it was.But the issue: Gary's problem, according to his ex wife in the beginning of the film, is that he wont change. And to her that's unfortunate because he's passionless and nerdy and stiff. So, throughout the movie as we watch him change into Ron we hear him teach his students about morality and the psychology of the self, which eventually leads him to the conclusion that moral absolutes don't exist and persistent personalities don't either - we can change who we are, we can change right and wrong, its all just contructs anyways. So, in the end he becomes a tough guy and a murderer. And we're supposed to be happy for him.If my girlfriend told me \"you need to change\" and I came back the next day as a psychopath she wouldnt thank me. She'd say \"thats not what I meant.\" Because any conversation about whether we can change is not just about change for change's sake. That was never the question. Gary's problem in the beginning of the film was that he needed personal growth and by the end he still didn't have it. He went from a nerdy guy who was antisocial in a not-talkative way to a cool guy who is antisocial in a clinical way.If they made it tongue in cheek that he'd become a murderer I could see it being passable because its edgy. We could say its satire. But they don't do that. It feels like they really believe that Gary did the right thing in the end. They don't treat him like the subject of a character study. They give him the happily ever after treatment like a hero. He kills his coworker so he can keep going steady with his secret friend with benefits, who also just confessed to murder. And then he says \"yeah that guy was kinda racist and misogynistic\" so we feel less bad about it. And then it cuts to him telling his students \"there are no absolutes.\" The absolute frustration I felt at the end of this movie got me thinking absolutes do exist.All in all I admit I enjoyed most of the movie. My advice is to watch it and then towards the end just pause it and make up an ending for yourself (thats just a social contruct, right? As Gary would say). Then you can have a great time and avoid the feeling someone is secretly trying to convince you to become a villain.P.",

After their first meeting, Ron convinces her to leave his husband, and they start a steamy relationship that quickly brings chaos into both of their lives.It's rare to see new and original ideas in cinema, and to see them well executed is even rarer. Hit Man is all that with very popular lead Glen Powell, who seems to be on a roll, and the incredibly beautiful and talented Adria Arjona. Their chemistry is incredible.Glen Powell had an incredible performance, portraying multiple personalities all of them with flawless ease. From the nerdy real teacher to cold killer or confident lover.",

        "description": "STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulGary Johnson (Glen Powell) is a high school teacher, with a side hustle helping the police on the side. One day, he is selected to work in a series of undercover sting operations, getting wire-tapped confessions from those planning on arranging contract killings. But things take a misfiring turn, when he ends up falling for one of his assignments, in the shape of Madison (Adria Arjona), a young woman at the behest of her abusive ex, only for things to take a massive turn when crooked agent Jasper (Austin Amelio) gets in on their arrangement.There was a film from 1997 called Grosse Pointe Blank, that received some critical acclaim at the time despite a limit in much of the way of a wide release. Writer/director Richard Linklater's film would seem to owe much of its inspiration to this source, and seems to be another well received subversive take on the 'hitman' genre, spinning conventional wisdom of the standard tropes of films featuring these characters on their head at one point, with a colourful montage of past films from this genre, from some of the oldest ones to more modern stuff like 2008's In Bruges.Linklater's film seems a confusing jumble of genres, with elements of action, comedy and thriller thrown into the mix, but somehow keeps you engaged with everything that's going on, an original, engaging film, with its sly, wise-cracking script never letting up, and never letting the pace sag. It helps that the cast are all relatively unknown, and so no one overshadows the script or film in itself. That said, lead stars Powell and Arjona are perfectly up to the job, Powell curiously convincing as a man who can alternate between mild mannered lecturer and guy caught up in the criminal underworld, whilst Arjona is a sultry seductress who serves as a perfect foil to everyone's plans.It's an unsteady combination of different genres, and as a result it sometimes comes off weirdly, most notably with a morally iffy ending that could leave you feeling funny. But somehow, it all works, and you're left with one of the most original and worthwhile efforts in a while. ****",

There were so many plot holes and unbelievable situations that made this a bad movie, despite best efforts from everyone involved. From plot elements and settings from movies like \"Body Heat\", \"American Psycho\" and \"Twin Peaks\", I guess there was foreshadowing that in the end, we would are going to discover that the 2 main characters are just your typical garden variety psychopaths/murderers. The things that happen in the movie are unbelievable. The way Powell's character Gary starts to act once we find out what Madison really is doing is unbelievable. The movie completely falls apart when we find out the truth and the story becomes completely ridiculous at that point. Along with the silly \"The idea of You\", this movie and others being churned out have beautiful stars with great acting talent and sexy love scenes, but the scripts are stupid, poorly written and derivative. Cringed hard for the pilot fantasy scene. Hoping Powell's next movie will have a good script. The Brooke Shield's rom com was horrid as well - one of many terrible movies out there.

He's a university professor who also finds himself working for the New Orleans police department pretending to be a hit man so as to entrap potential killers who don't want to do the killing themselves.It's totally far-fetched but who says that even 'true' stories have to be believable ; as a certain Mr. Hitchcock said, 'it's only a movie' and this 'screwball-rom-com-neo-noir' certainly is no documentary and as a genre piece it hits all the right buttons while still managing to appeal to the usual Linklater aficionados.

Arjona actually has a lot of charm and reminds me of Meghan Markle with a few brief flashes of Monroe.The plot is fine - although it all goes on too long and 40 minutes pass before we even see Arjona. However, after that it picks up and as the plot thickens I actually started to care about how they would get out of the mess they were in.And then we have three inexcusable errors:-1. Arjona apparently is the person who murdered her husband. This is a twist I didn't expect to see and although - sure - it does indeed make things more difficult and sets up an amusing scene where Powell has to silently coach Arjona what to say while they're being listened to by the cops on his wire, are we really supposed to give her a pass for murder? I mean, she's cute, but not that cute!2. In order to cover up the fact that she murdered her husband Powell then proceeds to murder in cold blood the (admittedly annoying) cop who's figured out the truth and is trying to shake them down for the insurance money. Sure, he's not a nice guy, but our leads have committed TWO murders now and we're still supposed to be on their side?3. And then, to top it all off, instead of them both dying in an accident or getting their just desserts (not pie) in some other way... THEY JUST LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER on the insurance payout from murdering her husband!Seriously, whoever thought it was acceptable to make a comedy where both the main characters commit murder and then live happily ever after with no retribution whatsoever is a disturbingly morally deficient individual.And then the movie production company approved this and it gets an 85 review score on Metacrtitic?Am I losing my mind here, or is there something seriously wrong with the society we're living in these days?2/10 because Arjona is cute.",

        "description": "In Richard Linklater's Hit Man, philosophy lecturer Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) ponders the question of how many people truly know themselves. The film tells the story of Johnson working for the New Orleans Police Department as a fake hit man for its sting operations. He is an amiable, Honda Civic-driving, bird-watching Everyman in shorts and glasses, who turns out to be the perfect fake assassin. Despite his unreadable face, Gary gets the gig at a moment's notice because the usual guy got caught beating up teens and got himself a 120-day suspension. However, Gary is a natural and convincingly transforms into a badass as soon as he meets his mark. This is similar to the scene in Collateral where Jamie Foxx's mousy cabbie has to pose as Tom Cruise's stone-cold assassin and suddenly becomes a new man. Glen Powell's performance in Hit Man might make him a movie-star because it is at heart a fantasy. Gary plays a figure out of our collective imagination, playing a figure out of our collective imagination. He researches his clients beforehand and tailors his look for their expectations of a hit man, making up the character as he sees fit. He meets Madison (Adria Arjona), a terrified wife being tormented by an unstable, domineering husband. She tries to hire Gary, but he slyly convinces her to give up on the idea because he doesn't want her going to prison. They fall in love, but she thinks he's still \"Ron,\" the grizzled, open-collared killer who showed her some genuine compassion and impromptu life coaching. Gary also thinks he's Ron, or at least becomes Ron whenever he's with her, so much so that he's now a demon in bed. He has the instincts of a tougher guy when they're together, and when Madison's estranged husband spots them at a club and threatens them, Gary immediately pulls out a gun, Clint Eastwood-style, and backs him off. Hit Man is a film that deconstructs the concept of stardom by presenting a character we cannot be, and then making us believe we can be him. The film's amiable filmmaking and Powell's charming, self-aware swagger are infused with the idea that anything is possible, making the world seem open, malleable, and accepting. The auteur theory has been criticized for its lack of focus on the material, but Linklater's breeziness and generosity as a director work wonders in this film. It serves as a rebuke to other hit-man movies at Venice this year, such as David Fincher's The Killer and Harmony Korine's Aggro Dr1ft. Linklater's film feels genuinely fresh, with fun for the star and the audience. The film's overt philosophical digressions, such as Gary's lectures to his classes, are easygoing and lively. Linklater's gentle touch is his secret weapon, and Hit Man might be a masterpiece. The film's overt philosophical digressions, in the form of Gary's lectures to his classes, are equally easygoing and lively.",

A director who has known how to provide great black comedies, once again achieves the task of satisfying us as viewers with an intelligent, well-thought-out and very well-structured film, which in turn leads you to immediately connect with a story that seems to be going too slowly, but That, just like its protagonist, makes an immediate click and we don't realize how deeply we are immersed in a plot that captivates us as each dialogue passes.Also for everything to work perfectly we need effective protagonists and Glen Powell shows everyone that he is an actor who is efficiently reaping his current moment of recognition, beyond the physical appearance, he is also a very good actor and Here we can see it in all its dimension and in all its aspects that allow it to shine from beginning to end. In that same place we can leave Adria Arjona, who possibly gives one of her strongest performances to date, complementing herself and sharing her level with her co-star without having to reproach an actress who is on the rise. Two incredibly well-written and very well-acted characters with whom it is impossible not to have a connection with them.It is such an intelligent film that hides behind its title all the deception that its characters possess, it is a clever and hilarious comedy that incredibly in its dialogues hides the best weapon to provide you with the most absolute entertainment so far this year. We are left with a sexy and ingenious proposal that is positioned as an entertaining proposal beyond the explosions and chases. A captivating comedy that dares to narratively go beyond the commonplaces that logic might presume. The Linklater style is more than present in the one that also elevates a new Hollywood star like Glen Powell.A satisfactory film in all its aspects that crosses different genres without clashing in any of them and allowing itself to establish itself as one of the most refreshing proposals so far in 2024. It deserves to be seen and enjoyed and to indulge in the fun of an original proposal , conquering, exciting and perfectly achieved.",

        "description": "The premise was fun: professor turns undercover hitman and comedy ensues. This unfortunately spun into something else altogether. Acts 1-2 stick to the formula pretty well, some laughs, some intrigue, but never fully develops the main character. I was watching it with my wife and it failed to keep her attention even with Hollywood's current flavor of the month on the screen.Enter the love interest..... let's see where this leads. Off the rails is where it goes for one of the more wtf movie endings I've ever seen. I'll avoid spoilers, but it was so bad, so bizarre, my wife got up and left the room saying \"I can't watch this.\" It left me thinking they must have skipped the test screening because no normal audience with any kind of basic moral compass would have liked the ending.It's amusing that Glenn Powell is being shoved down our throats at a firehose level these days. He's a good looking fella with moderate talent, but oof does he come off as someone you just want to throat punch. Many more of these duds and I suspect we won't see as much of him shortly. So tired of the hype machine tricking me into watching mediocre garbage.",

        "description": "It's a sly undercover police drama set in modern times in New Orleans, Louisiana. It follows a divorced, mild-mannered psychology professor, Gary Johnson (Glen Powell), who lives alone with his two cats, Id and Ego. He has also worked part-time with the New Orleans Police Department as a technical advisor on some undercover operations. Suddenly, Jasper (Austin Amelio), the guy who usually plays the undercover role of a hitman, is suspended, and Claudette (Retta) and Phil (Sanjay Rao) co-opt Gary to fill in. Gary proves amazingly skilled at his job with his forgettable face, many disguises, and believable sales pitch. Nonetheless, Gary's ex-wife (Molly Bernard) encourages him to liven up his personality.Suddenly, Gary meets Madeline Masters (Adria Arjona), a beautiful young woman who wants to have her husband, Ray (Evan Holtzman), killed. Rather than trap her, Gary encourages her to flee her husband and begin her own life. Soon, Gary and Maddy begin a relationship in which she still believes Gary is a hitman, and Gary's police colleagues are unaware of his relationship with a potential suspect. The movie then unfolds through many twists and turns that threaten their relationship and their trust in one another.\"Hit Man\" is a supremely clever story loosely based on a real Gary Johnson in Houston. It has a romantic comedy edge against a film noir backdrop. Powell and Arjona have excellent chemistry. The script lags a little in the middle but sprints to the end and has a good film noir ending.",

It goes over like a lead balloon.Most of the hitman scenes are comical and it just gets worse over time, eventually becoming a full on rom-com from the 80's.I expect more from a movie than retold situations that have been done over and over. Provide the audience with something new and interesting. And when the writer attempted that here it's not good and so awkward.The wrap up ending and mostly silly overacting do not help Glen Powell attempt to replace Ben Stiller and all the critics are saying this is a 8-10 star film. That implies that there aren't any mistakes or that you'd watch it again. Highly doubtfull. 4/10, some average parts but mostly a retread movie dressed up.",

Thus, I had an initial hesitation about watching this solely because I thought it would come out to be a letdown by comparison. But no, Glen Powell signed on to another entertaining extra-base hit. He showed good range between his two characters and has a natural charisma to him. I'm not the least bit bothered by the ending....some reviewer above complained about 'killing the honest cop'....excuse me?....blackmail/extortion extols someone's honesty? Neither the abusive husband's nor the sleazy, opportunistic cop's demise put me off. They were threats to the protagonists' life (and/or life together). Nor do I have no complaints about the female lead's appearance, mannerisms or acting ability. She was perfectly fine for the role. The chemistry quotient between the leads was adequate for the job. This is an easy movie to just sit back and enjoy. It has some plot twists to provide a little edge, but not so much to be hard to follow.",

The humours and twists & turns of the story were entertaining. The ending, however, was overly simplified and short that left unsatisfactory taste in my brain. With this kind of story, it's probably better to hang it rather than close the chapters with overly simplified and happy ending.Glen Powell is certified hunk to watch for in the future. He made the right moves to be likable and bankable leading star. And the small casts of actors did well, at least for this film. The heavy lifting was always in 2 hands, Linklater and Powell.For those who doesn't know Richard Linklater's works, such as Dazed and Confused, you might want to check his older films. Hit Man is an easy box office hit, a winning date night film for chilling with romantic evening.

Movies can do so much, this does the absolute basic minimum.I could feel the Netflix-level movie quality within the first 5 minutes. It's not cinematic at all. 90% of this movie is narration or a two-person conversation, usually in a booth of some sort, with regular cuts back and forth to each character. This is what I mean when I say boring. Zero imagination or ingenuity.Some people might still be able to enjoy it, but all I'm left with is a barely serviceable romantic-comedy which could barely make me chuckle.

She is a knockout ( especially in her red dress). One thing I don't think it is a comedy. More like Black Comedy such as MASH or The Trouble With Harry ( although I preferred Hit Man to both), it is about a hit man named Gary John ( Glen Powell), who falls for his target ( Madison). Of course just looking at her it is pretty easy to do so, Spoilers ahead: Do they end up together? Yes they do ( although people get killed like her abusive husband and a crooked cop). I am a huge fan of the ending where they are married with children ( and still in love with each other). Why? I despise ambiguous endings.

Gary, however, is more charming than lethal and soon finds himself falling for her and trying to talk her out of the crime.Things get messy (in a hilarious way) when a crooked cop, played perfectly by the ever-despicable Austin Amelio, gets suspicious. This is where the movie truly shines. We find ourselves rooting for Gary and Madison, even though they're technically the bad guys. The witty dialogue and clever situations keep the laughs coming, and the chemistry between Powell and Arjona is undeniable.If you're looking for a fun, action-packed comedy with a surprising heart, Hitman is a must-watch.

        "title": "\"Hit Man\": A Neo-Noir Masterpiece in Exploring Identity and Morality",
        "date": "11 June 2024",
        "description": "Known for his distinct storytelling style and vision, director Richard Linklater has returned once again with his latest film, \"Hit Man\", a neo-noir genre that highlighted Linklater's keen observations on human nature. The film stars Glen Powell as Gary Johnson, a seemingly strait-laced professor who leads a double life as a fake hitman for the New Orleans Police Department with a mission to capture these frustrated murderers. Gary's unique talent for adopting various guises and personalities enables him to trap those who wish to eliminate someone. However, his professional and ethical boundaries came to blur when he was contacted by Madison, played by Adria Arjona, to hire him to kill her husband. As Madison falls for one of Gary's personas---the sexy Ron---their steamy relationship ignites a series of play-acting, deception, and escalating stakes.The most effective aspect of the movie lies in the moral and psychological dilemma faced by the protagonist, Gary. As a professor, he teaches ethical principles promotes clear-cut notions of right and wrong, and identifies yourself. Yet, his secret activities forced him to navigate a morally ambiguous persona, creating a stark contrast between his personal and professional undercover work. This contradiction sets the stage for profoundly exploring his identity and ego. Gary's struggle to separate his true self from the various personas he adopts adds another layer to his characterization. This internal conflict is vividly shown, making viewers think about what really shapes our identity and how it changes based on the different roles we play in life and the different people we interact with.The main concept of the movie is the five-factor model of personality--- extraversion, neuroticism, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. This framework created another layer to the main character's emotional depth. Throughout the film, Gary has presented different types of personas and it begs the question as to where amongst the five factors does his personality change belong. This idea isn't just interesting but also makes the story deeper, offering a lot to think about for anyone curious about psychology and how characters develop. It makes you wonder about how flexible our identities can be and how outside events shape who we are, adding a unique psychological twist to the movie.The screenplay is also one of the movie's greatest strengths. Co-written by Richard Linklater and Powell, the movie serves as a masterclass in the simplicity and ingenuity of the script. In general, movies don't have to rely heavily on grand and over-the-top dramatic twists, and this is where \"Hit Man\" excels. The screenplay focuses on the nuanced character development and clever plot turns that allow the audience to be continually engaged. The writing in this movie is very tight, witty, and full of subtle surprises, despite having some pacing issues in the first two acts, the movie's clever script and engaging dialogues make it compelling and fun to watch. Powell's involvement in the screenplay is a pleasant surprise for me as well, this showcases his versatility beyond acting and proving his capability as a writer.Glen Powell's performance is nothing short of a revelation. To be honest, one of my worries in this movie is Glen Powell, I fear that he might just be another boy next door, potentially making his performance less convincing. However, Powell dispels these doubts with his multifaceted portrayal of Gary and his various personas. His ability to seamlessly transition from one character to another, each with its own unique charm and complexity, is genuinely impressive. The chemistry between Powell and Arjona adds another layer of intensity and sensuality to the film. Their dynamic as actors embodies a dark and romantic comedy vibe that fits well within the neo-noir genre which allows the narrative to be very enriching and emotionally deep.Despite its strength, the movie is far from perfect. The pacing in the first and second acts can feel sluggish, as the narrative takes its time to build up Gary's undercover exploits. This slow and gradual build-up can be very overwhelming to some viewers, making you question the direction of the story and where it's heading. The film spends a considerable amount of time establishing Gary's various personas, and in the 2nd half, the relationship buildup between Gary and Madison is overtly done. However, as the movie progresses and once we've reached the 3rd act, the movie brings clarity and resolution, tying together the movie's themes and character arcs in a satisfying conclusion. At 1 hour and 50 minutes, the movie could have benefited from tighter editing to maintain a more consistent pace and keep the audience more engaged throughout.Overall, \"Hit Man\" has all the elements of a perfect film-smart writing, good performances, and an unusual Bonnie and Clyde love story. The writing is clever, simple, and with the right amount of twists that work seamlessly with the material. It stands out as a crowd-pleasing addition to the neo-noir genre and is a testament to Richard Linklater's skillful storytelling. Despite its pacing issues, the film ultimately delivers a compelling narrative that resonates with audiences. Glen Powell's performance and the clever exploration of identity make \"Hit Man\" a memorable and thought-provoking cinematic experience. The film's visual style is another standout feature, with Linklater's keen eye for detail creating a world that feels both grounded and surreal. The New Orleans setting provides a rich, atmospheric backdrop that complements the film's themes of deception and identity. The cinematography captures the city's moody, noir-esque ambiance, adding another layer of depth to the narrative.In true Richard Linklater fashion, \"Hit Man\" is a home run, solidifying its place in his impressive filmography. The film's unique blend of psychological depth, moral ambiguity, and romantic intrigue makes it a standout in the neo-noir genre, offering a narrative that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally engaging.In conclusion, \"Hit Man\" is a film that succeeds on multiple levels. It is a smart, engaging, and thought-provoking addition to the genre, with strong performances, a compelling narrative, and a unique exploration of identity and morality. Richard Linklater and Glen Powell have created a film that is both entertaining and intellectually stimulating, proving that the neo-noir genre still has plenty of room for innovation. Whether you're a fan of Linklater's previous work or new to his filmography, \"Hit Man\" is a film that is sure to leave a lasting impression.",

He's a professor teaching general psychology, but in his spare time, he works with the local police force. Doing of all things being a fake hitman.It didn't always start that way. At first, he only worked on the technical side of things. Working with \"Phil,\" played by Sanjay Rao, \"Claudette,\" played by Retta, and \"Jasper,\" played by Austin Amelio. \"Jasper\" who you might remember from playing \"Dwight\" in \"The Walking Dead\" was the head undercover officer playing a hitman.When \"Jasper,\" who is a scumbag, got suspended, they needed someone on the fly to help. \"Gary\" was forced on the spot to fill in for \"Jasper.\" A decision that affected his life forever.Being better than even \"Jasper\" was, which was a shock to everyone. Plus he wasn't a cop officially. \"Gary\" used elaborate disguises and could somehow tap into the head of the person who was trying to order a hit. Getting many people arrested and saving a lot of lives.But a woman named \"Madison,\" played by Adria Arjona, who was looking for \"Gary's\" services, threw a monkey wrench into the op. Now being clouded by beauty and getting lost in disguise. \"Gary\" is going to be forced to make a lot of difficult decisions and be tempted to lead a stray. In this surprisingly based on a true story film.\"Hit Man\" was another home run by Glen Powell. Who was also a producer, helped create the story, and was involved with this film from top to bottom. This was his baby, and he did a great job with it.The acting was great, and the story was so intriguing. A lot of films I've watched recently have been so entertaining, partly because they are derived from true events. It just makes things better when you think about how this happened.Unfortunately, the real Gary Johnson passed away. He was an intriguing man who had a true calling, I can't lie. Some stuff was dramatized, but a lot was real. It's fascinating. He should be cheered for all the lives he saved.Glen Powell is on a heater, and he has another potential smash coming our way next month in \"Twisters.\" Let's see if he can keep shooting at this clip. Anyway, this was a fun film that was entertaining and frustrated you at times. But all in a good way.

The actors all did a fantastic job, the script was sharp, well written and didn't distract from the plot. There was a lot of spark between the characters, backed up by no over-padding back stories, they just laid it out there and enjoyed the ride. I wouldn't go so far as to call it an out and out comedy, but it was humourous in an intelligent way. There was a certain amount of predictability but I also caught myself being denied some leading assumptions. If I were to be critical in any way it would be that the pacing at the beginning was a little laboured, we really didn't need to see all those perps being stung and the personalities of the main character, but I understand why the writer felt the need to embed his chameleon-like persona. I do think it could have gotten away with being a bit darker, and the ending was a bit too sugar-coated for me - more akin to a rom-con, and it could have again, gotten away with being more of a thriller/noir type movie, with a bit more of a twist at the end.

Richard Linklater, one of the most captivating writer-directors of our times, is the guy behind that (sudden) change of perspective. He brings them together in such a fun, quirky little rom-com that takes advantage of their sizzling chemsitry. Like, wow. I didn't think Powell could actually take on a role with not one, but two personas embedded within. Arjona is too darn hot, and I like her even more when she moves as good as she speaks. And then, there are the signature Linklater dialogues on life's little pleasures, and random stuff like the cosmos, fish, signing contracts, pies, slicing fingertips, and whatnot. Gosh, not many can treat ARTICULATION like the sexy skill it is.. King Richard Linklater and his intriguing philosophies, I'm forever SOLD!The humor in the film is candid, subtle, and situational. There are some great puns and parallels drawn, with dialogues doing a lot of the work. What stops me from rating this any higher is the rather convenient ending (which I kinda foresaw) and it lacked the element of surprise that the rest of the film was nearly able to pull off. But for what it's worth, this once again proves that two actors who are better known for their physical appearance, can in the hands of a great director, impress you with their performances. The foreplay/sex scenes in the film are magnificently executed, and you'll almost feel the HEAT occupying the entire room. To think this was the exact opposite I felt when I saw Glen Powell & Sydney Sweeney together in Anyone But You.. speaks volumes!P. S. Full marks for the Patrick Bateman reference.",

His partner in crime, Adria Arjona, holds her own with snark and sass, making this dynamic duo an absolute delight to watch.

Yet year after year, the employer gonna get caught.Funny how the seemingly average citizen could be living a double life. By day, mild mannered teacher. By night a snitch for the local police.Life is to be lived. Could mean running with the bulls to climbing Mt. Everest. Sounds exciting. What's the flip side? Gored by a raging bull to falling off a cliff. Reaction to action. Be better at work, get promoted. Be a horrible employee and get fired. This movie has that constant sway to it. Then crazy love. Linklater's fun script brings out the crazy evil people. A person who falls over so soon and so easy, steer clear. Funny interesting is how I would describe this one.",

This film was inspired to make this from a magazine article to a movie.This movie also had good ending on where madison and gary got married. This so good moment on what they do to make their a good life and discovers their personality from each other that was nice thing from romantic and action movie.

        "description": "In a world where remakes are the only trend besides big budget super hero movies, this is a fun refreshing and unique look at the romcom. While there are some moments that drag, the story is engaging, the romance is enough to excite but not gratuitous. It's a fun movie that can be shared over a bottle of wine and slightly burnt popcorn. Probably the biggest hang up is the overly muscular lead that works as a psychology teacher with too many cats, but some how has the body of a Navy pilot. 😜 The rest of the ensemble is perfect and not too much time is spent on useless back story. The willing suspension of disbelief is perfectly balanced in this Friday date night movie you can enjoy with your better half.",

        "description": "\"Hit Man\" is probably the best romantic comedy I've seen in recent years. Typically, I avoid this genre due to its tendency toward shallow plots, clichés, and poor acting. However, \"Hitman\" breaks the mold with a well-produced, directed, and performed film that boasts an original premise.The delivery is brilliant, offering a slow-burn of mental stimulation that gradually builds. At around the one-quarter mark, the depth of the acting and the philosophical undertones provide an exhilarating high.Glen Powell is a true chameleon, showcasing his craft in the finest manner. His performance is nothing short of artful. Adria Arjona, on the other hand, brings a subtle unease to her role, hinting that something is amiss. Her nuanced acting is a testament to her talent.",

He consults on a police undercover team that targets clients hiring assassins. One day, the official undercover detective (Jasper) is suspended just as the team are onsite waiting to meet a 'client'.Gary is sent in and has to improvise. Surprisingly, mild Gary becomes a chameleon (Ron the hitman). Morphing into a variety of hitman characters that the clients trust. Incriminating the clients who are arrested after they hand over a down-payment.One 'client' is a pretty wife (Madison) that wants to have her abusive husband killed. Gallantly, Gary/Ron sends her on the way with advice to leave her husband (Ray). Unfortunately, Gary is smitten by this winsome woman. Foolishly, he follows up on Madison on his own time.The scheming Madison seduces Gary because she believes that he is Ron, a genuine killer. Learns how to murder Ray from her unsuspecting lover.To Gary's horror, Ray is shot to death. Suspicion falls on Madison because of a million dollar insurance policy. That's why the scheming Madison doesn't just divorce her husband. She also wants a payday after ditching her husband.At this point, anything could have happened. Had Gary come clean and helped trap Madison, Gary would have remained the mild psychology professor. Instead, Gary becomes an accomplice by shielding Madison. Helping her deceive the police.Then, there is the complication when Jasper (the undercover detective) gets greedy. Extorts the couple for the million door insurance policy. The psychopathic Madison drugs Jasper, and Gary chooses to suffocate Jasper. Using his experience to make it seem like a suicide.The deception works. Gary and Madison escape detection. Get married and have children. Somehow, the accomplices live happily after.There was the possibility of other outcomes Madison could have ditched Gary after getting her payday. Possibly, Madison stayed with Gary because he turned out to be a real life Ron (the bad boy).After all the criminality, Gary becomes more confident. Was there always a Ron hiding in Gary?The movie maker has cleverly posed the question. Who are we? Can we become the characters we play? Or, will the real person emerge under the right circumstances?Based on a real life character in Texas who helped entrap 60 clients looking to hire an assassin.IMO, the film would have been stronger with a better script. More tenson between Gary/Ron and Madison. The murderers turning on each other before reconciling.",

The film is based off a true story and centers around a quirky college professor named Gary who works part time for law enforcement playing a fake hitman to entrap and arrest those attempting to seek one out.The movie has plenty of jokes to go around and when the cop who primarily portrayed the fake hitman loses his thunder to Gary, the quirky college professor delves even more further into the job creating disguises and personas even quirkier than himself. It is upon meeting a beautiful damsel in distress named Madison that Gary creates a suave and friendly hitman persona named \"Ron\" that a fireworks of chemistry ensue between them.This is when the film hits its stride as Gary becomes more like \"Ron\" as the movie progresses until he essentially becomes this persona especially towards the dark ending when someone does end up dead and Madison is linked to it.I'm not against dark endings but this one felt a bit strange in that things go from dark and then happy go lucky so quickly you can't help but feel slightly disturbed instead of happy for Gary.Overall, a solid Linklater film that is funny with great dialogue that really shines due to Glen Powell and Adria Arjona's performances.",

        "date": "10 June 2024",
        "description": "In a lot of ways, \"Hit Man\" was a true-romance story instead of a true-crime one. It featured a so-called notorious undercover hitman who fell in love when least expected, thereby establishing a macabre rom-com undertone that was thoroughly entertaining.Imagine being mistaken for a good guy when you're working as a professional killer-for-hire, but only pretending to do so on the police's behalf, and in New Orleans to boot.That's what happened to Gary Johnson, who was played to outstanding effect by Glen Powell, who was casually funny, intense when needed, and charming otherwise. He was a psychology professor whose skills the police needed to cinch certain criminals, but then he got deep into the heart of things and lost his way; or rather, found a new one.The message at the heart of \"Hit Man\" became clear when Gary broke his own rules to help one of the contract-killer hirers - Madison Figueroa Masters (played engagingly by Adria Arjona) - escape her abusive husband Ray Masters (played notably by Evan Holtzman).There was a predictable twist connected to her character, but nothing so bad as to ruin the plot. A feel-good story coupled with rom-com vibes thus unfolded, with a generous helping of intrigue and humour.\"Hit Man\" 2024 contained a wealth of pleasant surprises. For starters, it felt like the story tapped into the ever-high demand for murder-misadventure tales and gave it a romantic twist, with an undercover civilian pretending to play a cut-throat character to bust various criminal endeavours.The movie also had a welcome 80s vibe. But what I genuinely admired about it was the fact that it was all based on a true story, and a very real Gary Johnson who worked as a college instructor (psychology and philosophy) by day and moonlighted as an undercover hitman for the New Orleans police.Sanjay Rao (as Phil), Retta (as Claude), Austin Amelio (as Jasper), and Gralen Bryant Banks (as Sergeant Hank) did good work as the NOPD crew. Molly Bernard (as Alicia; Gary's civilian ex) gave a memorable performance as well.As for the wide-ranging list of contract-killer hirers, Mike Markoff (as Craig), Bryant Carroll (as Walt), Martin Bats Bradford (as Isaac), Jo-Ann Robinson (as a posh woman), Jonas Lerway (as Monte), Kate Adair (as Rita), Morgana Shaw (as Tammi), Ritchie Montgomery (as Marcus), and Richard Robichaux (as Joe) were all caricatured down to a T but nonetheless gave engaging (though brief) performances. According to Press reports, the real Gary Johnson died - 1947-2022. Obvious conspiracy theories notwithstanding, \"Hit Man\" was a careful nod to one of the shadiest professions still in existence today; don't let some of the dialogues in this movie make you believe otherwise.The plot also insinuated that even in the coldest of hearts, there might be the need to go good and help the innocent. But don't go trusting your friendly community killer after reading that line. Not all of them are keen on being as nice as Gary Johnson was, and he was the goddamned police (irony-sarcasm intended).The movie ended on a dark note, rife with psychological subtext but no real-life parallels. The OG Gary Johnson was, apparently, the \"chilliest dude imaginable\". There were also some interesting noir-movie easter eggs worth appreciating.\"Hit Man\" was one of the few movies to surprise me this year. For a story based on grim true-crime cases, its protagonist came across as skillfull, heroic, and entertaining in all the right ways. Such characterisation balance was genuinely admirable.\"All pie is good pie.\"--- --- ---\nSpecial shout-out to Kim Baptiste (as a defence lawyer), John Raley (as a defence lawyer), Jordan Salloum (as Ray's friend), Stephanie Hong (as Mindy), Joel Griffin (as Peter), KC Simms (as Jerren), and Murphee Bloom (as Gwen).",

Sad that these actors are considered rising stars from this absolute dumpster fire.The start was actually promising. I was genuinely enjoying it and really thought I'd like Glenn Powell or whatever his name is. I'd never even heard of him before this but yikes, my hopes came down crashing and burning like all my expectations in men do. What on Earth was this? His acting is okay at best. Not great, but good enough to watch, but that's really it. The multiple disguises he did...eh, I didn't buy it. How did none of the people he hired find him suspicious? The Russian accent was so over the top, it was like he was cosplaying. Anyway, 50 minutes into the movie and nothing, and I mean NOTHING was happening. Just a montage of him going through different disguises. Seriously, what is this movie supposed to be? A comedy? Well, no, it wasn't funny. A romance? There wasn't much of a romance, just a whole bunch of making out and sex so it was more of an erotica. I sensed no chemistry for it, by the way, so that wasn't very believable either. Just made for awkward kink scenes. Instead of exploring the dilemma of Gary having to follow his morals and choosing justice over a woman he's falling in love with (which would have made for a more suspenseful movie), he turns into a murderer for a woman he just met and swaps his cats for dogs for her. It was giving hard simp energy. Gag me now. Aren't we supposed to like the leads in a movie?Also, how is Gary so comfortable and confident that very first time he had to fake being a hitman? It doesn't make sense. There's no internal or external struggle or anything outside of his teaching job that shows us that he's comfortable in switching personalities. We're supposed to be engaged with him, worry for him and fear for him fricking up his first mission. Now that would have been fun to see, especially him growing as a character. It falls flat because he almost seems too perfect at it. Just because he's seen other cops do it doesn't mean he can do the same. That's like saying I've helped around on movie sets and seen people act for years so that must mean I can act.I'm even more surprised by the positive reviews that seem to be slapped across my face everywhere. These people must either be paid or they just like jumping on the band wagon of anything that Hollywood critics claim is 'good', which by now I know to believe the exact opposite.The moral message of this movie is messed up and kinda evil. Because there is no morals. The only message that stands out to me is that murder is okay because love prevails. A bucket load of horse dung if you ask me.Gary is smitten the moment he sees the FL (I forgot her name lol oops). She tries to justify her desire to see him dead because he is bad, but this is never shown. She wants to kill him because...uh, he didn't like her wearing miniskirts? Oh no, what a piece of unworthy trash! It wasn't like she was in an abusive relationship because she literally just ups and leaves him. If it was that easy, why wasn't that her first move? She really needed some random hit man to tell her that for her to leave him. Isn't she an adult? That pretty much confirms her character: psychopath.Gary, as Ron, supports her despite him being shown as this sweet guy who is always on the right side of the law. Why? Because he's having sex with a woman that looks like a supermodel and he prolly wouldn't ever get a woman like that under normal circumstances as Gary. I understood why his ex wife left him, not because he refused to change but because he's lowkey pathetic. He saw the red flags and just decided to ignore them but boy, these weren't just red flags. These were blatant red sirens. She lied to him about getting divorced and lied to him about killing someone. I'm supposed to believe it'll end happily between them regardless of whether they have kids or not? Who's to say he won't end up like her ex? Does he find that hot? None of it made SENSE.We're also told Jasper is a jerk and sure, he's annoying and had an ulterior motive but he didn't deserve to die! When Jasper dies in front of them, Gary was shocked for only two minutes. He was strangely more calm about it. For someone who'd never seen a dead body before you'd think he'd react badly. He goes on to label Jasper as a racist, a misogynist to excuse the murder--the movie never shows Jasper as either of those so Gary literally had no qualms about slandering a poor dead dude to fit their convenience. To top it off, bro proceeds to make out/have sex with her despite there being a dead body right in front of them. Is this supposed to be funny? Sexy? No, it was vile. So really he's a murderous psychopath too, but we never get an indication of his fragile mental state tittering on the edge of snapping before all this. There is no mention of any sort of dissociative disorder either (which would have made a little more sense) so...he's throwing away any semblance of who he is as a person and his values for a stranger.Gary is clearly turned on by all this because he ends up dropping the L bomb at the end. I understand she's beautiful, but really? They don't even know each other or have anything in common, except for the fact that they're both insane. All the moments where they could have tried to make it into a good romcom is made meaningless by a script full of sex, boring dialogue and lacklustre acting. But I guess Hollywood relies on all that to keep the attention of hormonal teenagers---and to cover up the fact that there is literally no plot.This is the kind of rubbish Hollywood is throwing out there. Hard pass. If there is anyone telling you this is an amazing movie, just run.",

It was somewhat understandable that Madison (Adria Arjona) found his hit man persona intriguing, so that their sex scenes were, at least mechanically, on the warm side.My favorite part was Jasper's murder; I really didn't like that guy, even if he was the only cop on the team who was capable of critical thinking, refusing to believe the audio-monitored act put on to make her appear innocent. The audience then has to be as dumb as the other cops in accepting Jasper's suicide cover-up. (What? No autopsy finding the drugs she gave? And what drugs? She got where?)\nThen the movie abruptly jumps to years after the two murders they got away with to the happy familial ending.",

Not at all the fun quirky movie outing we had planned for. Save a precious 2 hours of your life and avoid this dreadful waste of time nonsense.

        "description": "I always look forward to the films of Richard Linklater, whom I consider one of the most interesting American filmmakers. His films manage to bring to the screens novel landscapes of American reality and characters that involve their viewers. His persistence in long-term projects has managed to transform time perspectives that span many years and decades into plots and images. Linklater is constantly looking for new characters to turn into stories on screen and new forms of expression to tell their stories. However, not all of his experiments are successful to my taste. This is also the case with 'Hit Man', an original combination which, however, failed to convince me.'Hit Man' is inspired by a real-life character named Gary Johnson, who lived in Houston and assisted the local police as an undercover agent, posing as a professional killer to those looking to buy assassination services and gathering evidence (mostly taped recordings of conversations) to arrest and prosecute them for planning murders. The script moves the action to New Orleans and assigns Gary the job of art teacher, showing him giving moral and life lessons to his young students. As long as he builds the character of the teacher who masquerades as different variants of professional killers, adapting his physiognomy and attitude to the 'clients', the film is interesting and funny. When the romantic component is added, it becomes less believable, not to mention the moral and legal ambiguities. What doesn't work? To a large extent, the role and activities of the police assistant hero are based on the first impression, or if you want, on the prejudices through which people judge those around them. The police disguises may fool the buyers of crime services, but the identity game on which the romantic story is based is more difficult to believe. A relationship based on false identities has no chance of standing the test of time. Or maybe the script wants to tell us that true love can overcome even lies about identity? Such a message is too trivial to support the surprises in the second part of the film. Linklater uses tools from the film noir toolkit mixed with romantic comedies and a little eroticism, but the combination just didn't work for me.Glen Powell is a good actor, but what he does in this movie constantly reminded me of Ryan Gosling and in cases like this I prefer the original. His romantic partner is played by Adria Arjona, who looks fantastic but whom I need to see in other roles to convince myself of her acting qualities. 'Hit Man' is a movie that many will like, OK as entertainment, but I found it to be one of Richard Linklater's weaker movies. In my opinion, this is one of the highly overrated movies of this season.",

Unfortunately, we were disappointed on every level. The story and acting both reflected a self-consciousness that was distracting and off-putting. The creative team may have had fun conceiving and executing this project, but rather than getting pulled in by a clever and entertaining story, we were left with the sense that they wanted us, the viewers, to be impressed with their cleverness and cool. It felt like being in the presence of a person that not only thinks they are the smartest person in the room, but are determined to let us know how smart they are. The film's subject appears to be that we need to actively endeavor to be the people we want to be, but that ostensible message rang hollow due to the self regard which permeated both the storytelling and performances. In the end, this felt like more of an exercise in style with very little substance, which in part may reflect a shift in focus due to the creative team's decision to take a real person and story and embroider fictional subplots onto it that felt hollow and thin emotionally.",

Ron taking down his first mark is fantastic.After that, zzzz.....What follows is a montage of similar scenes, as a bunch of poor rednecks - who somehow have thousands of dollars in cash laying around to hire a hit man - get taken in by Gary/Ron. It is also fairly obvious what the producers are telling us by making all of them white people with southern accents.Then a gorgeous Mexican-American woman tells him her husband is abusing her and he sympathizes with her and tells her to keep her money and they start an affair. There is never any evidence that her husband is abusing her. Yeah they bump into him and he's kind of a jerk, but that shouldn't warrant a death sentence.The writers try to give us a third-act twist but most viewers will see it coming a mile away. Then - no spoilers since it's in the trailer - she kills her husband after tweaking his life insurance policy to increase its payout. She doesn't get revealed to be some femme fatale with some Machiavellian plot. She just killed her husband, who may or may not have been abusing her.

It's as if he's trying to juggle too many genres at once, resulting in a messy mishmash of half-baked ideas that never quite come together. The pacing is as erratic as a squirrel on caffeine, leaving viewers wondering if they accidentally hit fast forward on the remote.The comedy itself is as stale as week-old bread, relying on tired clichés and recycled jokes that were tired the first time around. Powell's attempts at comic timing feel as awkward as a first date, while Arjona's straight-faced delivery only serves to highlight the lack of humor in the script.Overall, \"Hit Man\" is a swing and a miss for Netflix, offering little more than a cringe-inducing comedy that's as forgettable as yesterday's news. If you're looking for a laugh, you're better off rewatching old episodes of \"The Office\" or \"Parks and Recreation.\" As for \"Hit Man,\" it's a contract best left unfulfilled.",

Not huge stars by any means, but enough there to make the good reviews seem believable, especially when coupled with Linklater's name: what's not to like.A lot, as it turns out. I bugged out after struggling to feel engaged after 30 minutes of plodding set up...for a rom com!!To be clear, there's not a single frame of Rom in the first 30 minutes, and the com is laboured and repetitive - how many scenes do we need of a guy wearing lame disguises to fool dumb patsies in order to get the premise? A lot, apparently.Netflix is making a bad name for itself in making these half-cooked filler films, chucking money and names at material that needs at least one rewrite before seeing the light of day.Why do the majority of Netflix films feel like they've been shot on a tight budget to a strict deadline using first take cuts directed remotely by someone on a beach who's watching proceedings on a smartphone while stoned.I understand major film companies bury bad films for tax reasons, but Netflix's approach seems to be to produce and release more of them.More awfulness.Duh-Dull!",

Later learned I was right, the real Gary was an investigator for the local DA's office, so an official law enforcement officer.The entire romance was fictionalized. Okay, no real problem with that, done in so many 'based on true events' films. BUT having BOTH Gary and Madison end the film as happy go lucky murderers was absurd and neatly destroyed any semblance of 'romcom.' Such a totally needless ending.

Richard Linklater is a hit and miss filmmaker as he has made some pretty good movies but also some pretty bad ones in his career. Hit Man is different to his usual style and despite Linklater having good energy, I didn't connect with the movie as much.The narrative is pretty standard and typical of he thriller noir genre and despite Linklater adding some new tones, style and approach to the story, it oftentimes feel too cheesy and predictable to be fully engaged with. The camerawork, production and some of the tense and action moments were pretty good as it helped to add the atmosphere and environment. The performances are pretty good as Glen Powell continues to shine and he does an awesome job performing his character.The dialogue is interesting although some of the dialogue moments were a little too silly, some of the characters are interesting but some not as interesting. Linklater's direction was pretty solid but there are some aspects where his direction feels a little messy and unfocused at times. With the narrative being predictable and cheesy, it causes some of the moments for me to feel a little slow and slightly bored.Hit Man has some entertaining moments but just like Top Gun: Maverick, I find myself not being big on the cheesy action stuff.

The almost 2 hour run time felt like a barrage of acting reels showcasing Glen Powells range for his portfolio. The plot was murky and filled with plot holes leaving me bewildered with the actual purpose of the film. It took over 60 minutes to actually kick off the plot, the person i was with was literally sleeping for the first half hour due to how boring it was. The female characters were written as stereotypical as it can get, with the main female lead written as a cardboard cut-out mannequin with the only direction being her obsession with the main lead from the onset of the first interaction. It was honestly offensive and it was very obvious that a male had wrote the script. No nuance or any identity given to the character other than to say that she's hot.I was really disappointed in this film because I was ready and excited to see the new role for Glen, but it felt like I got massively duped. The least surprising thing about the movie was finding out Glen Powell was one of the writers. The almost 2 hour run time was solely surrounded on packing in as much opportunities to make Glen stand out amongst the badly written and plain side characters. At least an hour of the movie could've been cut out and we still would have gotten to the gist of the plot without sacrificing anything. No one took the the time to develop the script or make it anything better than elementary. I was honestly flabbergasted by the end of it on how it got so many good reviews. By hands down it is one of the worst movies of the year. It did give me a few chuckles of how absurd and ridiculous it was, so I will give them that I guess.To sum it up, this movie is abysmal and makes me worry for the future of film if this is touted as the gold standard of movies these days.",

If they wanted the audience on her side, they needed to make the dude a real douche - violent, unreasonable, controlling.

He has screen presence, for sure. In this film, because we can see the problematic, untrustworthy female lead from five blocks away, he kept conjuring up another male lead from an old favorite film noir of the 80s. More about that later.For now, Powell's \"everyman\" engages from the start. Interestingly, he develops from average looks to sexy bad boy through the film. But you know those bad boys, they come at a price. And by the time the character achieves is good looks he also achieves a type of moral bankruptcy.The film grapples with being comedy and trying to say something about the meaning of life. And for viewers who aren't familiar with the various philosophical allusions tossed in the mix here, undoubtedly they will be left with a sense that this was just a harmless RomCom.The message is far from harmless, however, when during the professors final exam, he lectures his students about choosing their identities. I used to not think too much about the politicization and propagandizing of filmmaking, but when we reflect on identity issues in our current society, and then we have a film that glaringly screams \"identity\" and then wraps up the chosen identities in a nice little package of \"sociopaths win,\" then I have a problem.For all the shouting about \"have passion in your life, choose your identity hold onto it with grit\", screen writers choose to end with two sociopaths who have murdered, living the life of a traditional family unit, upper middle class to children to dogs, devoted to each other. Furthermore, when one of their children asks, how did mommy and daddy meet, the parents both promote deceit in explaining their past to their children.Now back to that 1980s film noir that I mentioned. I couldn't help feeling that somebody has a little bit of history with Body Heat. Glen Powell even reminds me somewhat of William Hurt and of course, the female lead has the same name as Kathleen Turner's Maddy, an unforgettable and deadly character. Because of my familiarity with that movie, I kept expecting hitman to take a dark more serious turn. Instead, I got this terrible ending, that really did not satisfy at all.",

Okay, fine, but what about the rest of the film?It starts out like a warped Walter Mitty type story, lots of comedy, stacked upon implausibility.Then it gets weird. The first clue that this isn't heading where you may think, is the philosophical debate about identity between Gary (Glen Powell) and his ex wife. The setup is that if you play act a different role for a few months, you eventually assume that new role and lose your old identity. Uh huh, sure you do. This is a dumb take on the old trope about cops going deep under cover, only to become as dirty as the people they were supposed to be chasing.In the beginning Gary is a nerd who's pushed into working undercover as a pretend hitman to snare people trying to hire contract killers. Amazingly he shows a remarkable ability to adopt a fake personality on his very first try.The coworker Gary replaces is a stupendous jerk, but also a clueless doofus. Gary's colleagues who listen in as he entraps his targets, are jokey profane dummies.Then Gary meets an attractive woman who wants to kill her husband and everything changes, and the tone of the film goes dark, and serious.Gary convinces her to forget about murder, and encourages her to move on. Then he takes up an affair with her, still pretending to be a hitman. Think about that for a sec: Gary wants to sleep with a woman who wanted to hire him to kill her husband, knowing that she thinks he's really a killer. SHE wants to sleep with a guy she believes to be an assassin. What are they thinking?The jokey shenanigans of Gary's colleagues turns serious too. When the woman's husband ends up dead things get even weirder. The replaced coworker turns into a slick undercover cop with a nose for solving cases, and a sleazy desire to mess with Gary. The dumb duo that made jokes in the beginning become earnest crime solvers. And Gary? He slips the leash and evolves into an amoral sociopath. Remember that convo he had with his ex? Sure.By the end of the film the whole story has changed into a pair of killers who think nothing of committing murder and then having sex on the floor next to the dead body.How did that happen?So instead of a nebbish caught up in a web of crime and trying to get out, we get a brand new criminal who kills people and helps others cover up their murdering ways.Nope.

        "description": "Can't believe the main character would be interested in a woman like that. Glen Powell's character that he played was sexy as is. Could have found a beautiful, respectable & non-murderous woman anywhere. I can't believe they both killed people in the end and Gary was an accomplice to murder. Gary seemed to be the type of guy not to mess in the wrong crowd & smart. In real life, the truth always comes out. They never would have gotten away with murder. The police wouldn't quit investigating Madison. Gary and his lover would have been found out. I wish Gary would've dumped her and in the end found a nice lady to be with and continued to be a cool teacher.",

        "description": "The first half of the movie is nice and the actors play very well! I really like the leading role which plays a modest teacher then he totally transforms when he is challenged to play the role of a hitman. So the movie was fine up to the point where we learn that Madison is a killer, but to get away with double murder like nothing happened? Ok, worse than that... Gary's final exam speech... he basically encourages anyone to be what they want, fine... but awful when you understand the fact that it includes being a killer! If there's no morality, then it means that you can easily become a killer as long as you don't get caught. Very very dangerous ending!!!",

        "description": "The movie starts very promising. Quite funny, however half way through... it's just repeating, repeating itself and bringing almost pornography scenes about of nowhere just to ... fill in the scenes with cheap production.The movie has quite some plot holes. Like how come that a boring guy like that, can turn into a mega list a mega actor?I could not finish watching this masterpiece of mediocracy. Please do yourself a favor, and watch something else.It's quite the teacher to become Chad from Screaming Queens, yes that one. Out of the blue, bam, Chad.It's quite promising, but halfway, went downhill.Like all post strike movies from Netflix.",

        "description": "I was so excited and what a confusing movie. First it's a comedy. Then it's a rom-com. Then it's a mystery. Then it's a thriller. Then it's a comedy. Then it's a romance.I didn't actually laugh once. I kept waiting for the twist at the end that would at least justify my slogging through to the end. It never came. Instead it was the worst ending I've ever seen. Powell and Linklater made a movie the average viewer will eat up and there's probably a sequel in there. Good for them. Make that money $$$$Light movie to watch on a date (or not really watch) would be perfect for this piece of junk.",

        "description": "We were left wondering when this movie was going to get going. For a romantic action comedy, nothing happens for the first hour and most scenes seem to be playing out like clever Tarantino dialogue scenes and are twice as long as they should be. There's no action involved and the whole hit man premise could have had a little more action injected into it.I am often left wondering if there is anyone at the helm of Netflix comedies. They seem to have little guiding them despite there being so much out there to mine from. Something like this could have had the energy of Midnight Run or Running Scared and be way more fun.The two leads are fine but you don't ever really believe that Glen Powell's character could switch so easily. The female lead doesn't seem to know who she is.This had a lot of potential but in my opinion let itself down in the first act.",
